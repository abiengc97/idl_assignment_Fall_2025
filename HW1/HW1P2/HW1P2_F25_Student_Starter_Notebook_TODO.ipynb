    "# Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by understanding the dataset for this homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data consists of 3 folders (train-clean-100, dev-clean and test-clean). The training and validation datasets (train-clean-100 and dev-clean) each contain 2 subfolders (mfcc and transcript). The 'mfcc' subfolder contains mel spectrograms (explained below and in writeup), while the 'transcript' subfolder contains their corresponding transcripts. However, the test dataset (test-clean) contains only the 'mfcc' subfolder without the corresponding transcripts, which will later be predicted by your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Audio Representation.\n",
    "The 'mfcc' subfolders contain many `*.npy` files of mel spectrograms. .npy files are used to store numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each .npy file represents a short speech recording. For example, one recording might be someone saying, \"This is the age of AI.\" This recording is converted into a mel spectrogram, which is used to represent all forms of audio signals in a computer. Such representation is important in signal and speech processing tasks, especially in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to raw audio, mel spectrograms are better for speech processing because they capture both the timing and the frequencies of the sound. At each moment in time, they show which frequencies are present in the sound. This makes it easier for computers to understand and process speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "When converting raw audio to spectrograms, you do not process the whole audio at once. Instead, you process small frames at a time as you stride over the entire audio length. This means that if you have an audio file of 100 seconds, you may decide to process 10 seconds at a time, striding by one second. In this case, the frame size is 10 seconds. The frame size and the number of timesteps (seconds, milliseconds, etc.) depend on individual choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing each frame, you extract a number of features that represent that frame's audio. For instance, in the audio recording of \"This is the age of AI,\" the frame corresponding to \"AI\" will have features that represent how \"AI\" is pronounced, the vocal tract, and the effect of the environment in which it was recorded. For clarity, when we say features, you should think of columns. One feature/column may have information about the gender of the person who made the speech. Another may have information about the age of the person. Another may have information about the environment where the speech was recorded. Basically, the main properties that make up a speech are encoded in those features, which combine in some way to make the audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to recognize the word as it was pronounced despite the environment and other variabilities, we usually normalize to eliminate or minimize such effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our spectrograms contain 28 features. Essentially, the number of features may be different. They may depend on how the raw audio data was converted into mel spectrograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Transcripts\n",
    "Remember where we mentioned frames? Well, in our dataset, audio frames have corresponding target transcripts. For instance the abbreviation \"AI\", in our example above, if present in the recordings, will have transcripts: /eɪ aɪ/. This means that you will have two frames one for  /eɪ/ and another for /aɪ/.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of representing pronounciation in text form is called ***phonetic transcription***, \"the conversion of spoken words the way they are pronounced instead of how they are written\"[[link]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://krisp.ai/blog/phonetic-transcription/%23:~:text%3Dphonetic%2520transcriptions%2520done.-,What%2520are%2520Phonetic%2520Transcriptions%253F,verbatim%2520to%2520intelligent%2520verbatim%2520transcriptions.&ved=2ahUKEwiV6LO6hrSHAxUKSvEDHcvwAAsQFnoECB0QAw&usg=AOvVaw0VqoWceOzdVwe-AvdyyWqJ). In this case letters 'A' and 'I' are pronounce /eɪ/ and /aɪ/, respectively. Both letters in different words may be pronounced differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The produced representation of the speech is referred to as phonemes. Various .npy files that contain recordings of the sentence **\"This is the age of AI.\"** would map to **\"/ðɪs ɪz ðə eɪdʒ əv eɪ aɪ/.\"** The phonemes representation for **Chelsea sucks** would be **/ˈtʃɛl.si sʌks/**\n",
    "\n",
    "Going inside the .npy files. Each .npy file contains vectors which have 28 features/dimensions/columns. The number of vectors in the file corresponds to the number of frames in the recording. And each single frame has a corresponding phoneme in the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance the .npy file for \"This is the age of AI\" --> \"/ðɪs ɪz ðə eɪdʒ əv eɪ aɪ/\" might have 13 frames (13 vectors):\n",
    "\n",
    "- /ðɪs/ has 3 phonemes: /ð/, /ɪ/, /s/  \n",
    "- /ɪz/ has 2 phonemes: /ɪ/, /z/\n",
    "- /ðə/ has 2 phonemes: /ð/, /ə/\n",
    "- /eɪdʒ/ has 2 phonemes: /eɪ/, /dʒ/\n",
    "- /əv/ has 2 phonemes: /ə/, /v/\n",
    "- /eɪ aɪ/ has 2 phonemes: /eɪ/, /aɪ/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chelsea sucks** --> **/ˈtʃɛl.si sʌks/** might have 8 frames (8 vectors):\n",
    "\n",
    "- /ˈtʃɛl.si/ has 4 phonemes: /tʃ/, /ɛ/, /l/, /si/\n",
    "- /sʌks/ has 4 phonemes: /s/, /ʌ/, /k/, /s/\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that recordings of different sentences may have different number of frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model you will produce must take a vector of a particular frame and predict the frame's transcript as accurately as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the **__getitem__** method of your dataset class must return a 28 dimensional vector of a particular frame and its corresponding phoneme transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, while you are doing your data preprocessing in the **__init__** method, you need stack all vectors from all recordings on top of each other. You must do this for all transcripts as well and remember to ensure the correspondance between frames and their phoneme mapping is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our dataset of two samples above, if you stack the recordings together, you get:\n",

    "So, if you pass index 5 to **__getitem__**, you will get back vector v5 (v5_1, v5_2, ..., v5_28) and transcript **/ð/**.

    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset we are using, a few millisecs were used to convert raw audio to mel spectrogram and extract the 28 features.\n",
    "Since each vector represents only a few millisecs of speech, it may not be sufficient to feed only a single vector into the network at a time. Instead, it may be useful to provide the network with some “context” of size K around each vector in terms of additional vectors from the speech input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, a context of size 3 would mean that we provide an input of size (7, 28) to the network - the size 7 can be explained as: the vector to predict the label for, 3 vectors preceding this vector, and 3 vectors following it. It is worth thinking about how you would handle providing context before one of the first K frames of an utterance or after one of the last K frames.\n",

    "2. The final autolab **code submission is due 48 hours after** the conclusion of the Kaggle Deadline (or, the same day as your final kaggle submission).\n",
    "3. Course staff will require your kaggle username here, and then will pull your official PRIVATE kaggle leaderboard score. This submission may result in slight variance in scores/code, but we will check for acceptable discrepancies. Any discrepancies related to modifying the submission code (at the bottom of the notebook) will result in an AIV.\n",
    "4. You are NOT allowed to use any code that will pre-load models (such as those from Hugging Face, etc.).\n",
    "   You MAY use models described by papers or articles, but you MUST implement them yourself through fundamental PyTorch operations (i.e. Linear, Conv2d, etc.).\n",
    "5. You are NOT allowed to use any external data/datasets at ANY point of this assignment.\n",
    "6. You may work with teammates to run ablations/experiments, BUT you must submit your OWN code and your OWN results.\n",
    "7. Failure to comply with the prior rules will be considered an Academic Integrity Violation (AIV).\n",
    "8. Late submissions MUST be submitted through the Slack Kaggle (see writeup for details). Any submissions made to the regular Kaggle after the original deadline will NOT be considered, no matter how many slack days remain for the student.\n",
