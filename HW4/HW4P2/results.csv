0,HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STILL FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FATTEN PIECES TO BE LAIDLED OUT IN THICK PEPPER TO FLAT AND SAUCE
1,STUFFED INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNCIL HIM
2,AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHLES
3,HOW BERTY AND HE GOOD IN YOUR MIND
4,NOW BUT TEN FRESH NOW HE IS WAITING ON YOU GOOD NIGHT HAS BEEN
5,THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS OF SHELLIES FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS
6,THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHERE ON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL
7,A COLD LOOSED INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL
8,THE CHAOS AND WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF
9,AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WEARILY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE
10,WELL NOW AND THIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK
11,ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THE SO DOUBT AT HE MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHION KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES
12,HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLDINGNESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER
13,IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER NIGHT
14,HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
15,BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOL ROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG
16,THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTION ON THE CADICISM THAT LIS
17,STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HER IN CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING
18,IT WAS STRANGE TO THAT HE FOUND AN AERATE PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIDGENDS OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCE AS ONLY TO HEAR AND FIELD THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
19,THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENSE AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROW IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE
20,IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO A MASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STILL IN ONLY WERE THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST A CRUING UPON IT OR ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE
21,IF A LAMEAN IN GIVING BACK TO THEM POOR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED
22,HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND
23,WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE YUKURIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SO UNDIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE
24,IF THE WINE CHANGE INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLED INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST'S STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN
25,A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEP INTO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION
26,THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATICISM TO HEAR THE LESSEN FROM
27,HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
28,THE RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FENCES ZAVIOR WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY
29,ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEATS
30,BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE
31,STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WHITHERING FLOWER
32,HE HAS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES
33,A GREAT SAINT FRANK FRANCES SAVE YOUR
34,THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON
35,HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVED SMOUNTAINS
36,A GREAT SAINT FRANCES SAVE YOUR
37,IN THE SILENCE THERE DARK FIRE CANDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNING GLOW
38,HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
39,FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
40,HE SET OFF A ROUGHLY FOR THE BOWL WALKING RAPIDLY LESS HIS FATHER SHRILL WHISTLED MY CALLED HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUND THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRICK AND WAS SAFE
41,THE UN OF VERSITY
42,BRID AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES
43,WHO IS FEET OUR AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS
44,THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED
45,SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
46,THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TO BUY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STATE OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE
47,AND WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOWS SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW A REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK CATS AND HUMBLE TAP LIKE COLLARS AND LOOSED LOOSELY HANGING
48,BROTHER MA CAR DARTLE BROTHER CEL
49,THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRACTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT
50,IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BETWEEN THEMSELVES
51,IDLE AND IN BITTERLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE SORT OF TUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
52,THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN A CHORD
53,WHERES WAS IT THEIR COLORS
54,THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NO MADS ON THE MARCH FLOATING A HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
55,THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRRECY EUROPE OF STRANGE TONS AND VALIATE AND WOULD BE GERT AND CITADEL AND OF ENTRENCHED AND MARSHLED RACES
56,AGAIN AGAIN
57,A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD OF HIS CALLING
58,HE LOW STEPHEN ELSE HE COMES THE DEADLESS
59,THERE DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SEPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE RUFFUMES OF THE SLOPING BREAK WATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSE PLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WET LUSTRE
60,HE STOOD STILL INDIFFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND BURIED THEIR BACHELOR WITH EASY WORDS
61,IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF AT A LESSONS THAT MADE REPELLANT THEIR PITYABLE NAKEDNESS
62,STEPHEN ELSE DAD LLS
63,A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DAINS HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE WRAPPED CITY
64,YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FORMER MEN TISSION WHOLE BLIND TURNER AND INFINITE IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
65,THAT YOU NOT EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERENCE THAN MISS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS GEORUS GIRLS
66,BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE PURESTRIOUS DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DECREES OF FORCE AND ONE THING ON SEPARATED LIGHT THE COLERIST HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS
67,MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY INFORMED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHOM I ATTEMPTED TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LENGTH HORSES OF DISTINCT HUGE SIDE BY SIDE
68,SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID AND LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTLE AS HARD AT THE EDGE
69,DOES THE HEAD OF A PARROT THE LITTLE FLOWER IN HIS DEEP FROM A PICTURE OF CARPOSIUS ONE OF HIS SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE
70,THEN HE COMES TO THE BEAK OF IT
71,THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH HIS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK AS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TO DO ALL GET LINES OF DARK GRAY TO FIND THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MENDABLE
72,FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL FLAWS FEAR OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT BEAUTY OF A CARCROBON IS TO BE READ AND A BRASS PLOT TO BE GRAIN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEASON ON THE MANIFOLD THE LISTEN OF LIGHT WHICH HE CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECEDENTS
73,NAT YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WIDEST ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER USE IT BECOMES SOME HOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF ENTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT
74,BUT IN THIS BEEN YET COPIED FROM CORNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT UP PERFECTLY
75,THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I KNOW EXISTING THE PENNANT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONS THEIR FAVORITE CHOSEN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAUGHTER TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
76,IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOYAL THE VIRTUE IS IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUNCE
77,IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
78,DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS AN EASY ONE
79,THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY WHERE LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
80,THIS AT ONCE COMPOSE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOUR PRODUCING JEWELLERS WERE RATHER THAN PICTURES
81,THAT A STYLES WERE STRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO A RUNNING US
82,IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTIONERY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
83,THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINEDS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE IN OLD DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFER HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
84,BUT OBSERVED KNOWING DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION
85,IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER INFLEESTY A FAITH NECESSARY FOR NO WILL PURSE PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY GAZED AND PROMOTING THE FULLESTY IN PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
86,YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHED YOU MAY YOU KNOW NOT THINK HE ABOUT THE WAY OF HIM
87,THE COLORS SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NESTY VI FOR SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I RUN HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE HAS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY
88,NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU AT THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON NEW MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
89,YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOLIAN MATERIALISM AND CLAY AND VALD ITSELF AT LAST AND CLOUD AND FIRE
90,HERE'S AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST HOLY AND GOLD MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHAT'S OVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE IN MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE
91,NOW HERE'S RALPHILE EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF HOLDING FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
92,WHILE THEN LAST HERE IS TERRORS GREEKS SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND IN THE ENVELOPED MET WITH AN EVENT
93,ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD IN FAR
94,HE KNOWS THEM BOTHER
95,THERE'S ONE IN THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
96,IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURN JONES IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
97,EVERY PLANET IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
98,EXC WAS AT ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH A TURNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRISTEL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETELY THERE WERE QUITE LITTLE BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHOSSER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS
99,THUS IN CHOSSES DREAM
100,IN BOTH THESE HIGH KNHYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOSE SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
101,EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IS IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGION IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHING'S CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRACKLE WORK OF HOLBORNE OR JEER
102,BUT NOW HERE'S A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURN A DROUET AT ALL
103,IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATEVER ESPECIALLY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
104,THE CROWDNESS IN THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
105,IT IS A GLEAN OR BRAIN DOWN HER ONE SHELF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL IT'S SELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET IT STONES TO TURN
106,THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY OURCADIAN
107,SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOYS CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED CITE
108,IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU KNOW NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF C HEIGHTS FLY FOULKENS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYED THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY
109,ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHERE BY LOVE MAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICCIES IN
110,HURRYING THE TIRESOME PLAIC DEVIT OF A TIRELESS TONGUE
111,AND GO OR PAIN PAINFUL TO HEAR
112,HAY FEVER A HEART TROUBLE CALLS BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GRASS WITH HER
113,HAVIN A GOOD PLACE TO BE RAISED TO
114,HAGE OF FENCE
115,HEARDITY THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
116,HOR'S SENSE A DEGREE OF WISDOM THAT KEEPS ONE FROM BEATING ON THE RACES
117,HOSE MAN'S EXCUSE FOR WEDDING THE WALK
118,HOW TAIL A PLACE WERE AGAINST OFTEN GIVES UP GOOD DOLLARS FOR POOR WATERS
119,HOWKS CLEANING A DOMESTIC UP HEVAL THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENLIST ALL THE SOLDIERS AT NEEDS
120,HAS BEEN THE NEXT THING TO A WIFE
121,HASTY WOMAN AND BOND TIME
122,TIGHT TO A WOMAN
123,HAMPRE CRITT A HORSE DEAR THERE
124,THOSE PRETTY WRONGS THAT LIBERTY COMMITS WHEN I AM SOME TIME ABSENT FROM MY HEART THY BEAUTY AND THY YEAR'S FULL WELL BIFICS FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU
125,I ME
126,NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FATHER'S EARTH REMOVE FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT CAN JUMP BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THE PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE
127,THOUGHT KILLS ME THAT I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAVE LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT I MUST ATTEND TIME'S LETTER WITH MY MOON RECEIVING NOT
128,MY HEART OFF PLEAD THAT THOU WIN HIM DOST LIE A CLOSET NEVER PIERCED WITH CRISTEL EYES BUT THE DEFEND AND DOTH THAT BLEED AN EYE AND SAYS IN HIM THY FAIR APPEARANCE LIES
129,YOU ARE MY ALL THE WORLD AN I MUST STRIVE TO KNOW MY SHAMES AND PRAISE IS FROM YOUR TONGUE NONE ELSE TO ME NOR I TO NONE ALIVE THAT MY STEALED SENSE OR CHANGES RIGHT OR WRONG
130,OH TIS THE FIRST TIS FLATTERY IN MY SCENE AND MY GREAT MIND MOST KINGLY DRINKS IT UP MINE I WELL KNOWS WHAT WITH HIS DUST IS GREEN AND TO HIS PALLET DOTH PREPARE THE CUP
131,BUT RECKONING TIME WHOSE MILLION ACCIDENTS CREEK IN TWIXED VOWS IN CHANGE DECREES OF KINGS TAN'S SACRED BEAUTY BLUNT THE SHOPEST INTENTS DIVERT STRONG MINES TO THE COURSE OF ALTERING THINGS
132,LOVE IS A BABE THEN MIGHT I NOT SAY SO TO GIVE FULL GROW TO THAT WHICH DO DOTH GROW
133,SO I RETURNED REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAINED BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT
134,IT WAS AS OBSERVATION THE TRUE FROM DOUGLAS ANALS IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING OF REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
135,SOME ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING
136,CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
137,THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THEIRS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER RICH IN HIS BEYOND WAY HE EXPLAINED
138,THE STORIES WRITTEN
139,I COOL RIGHT TO MY MAN AND CLOSE THE KEY HE COULD SEND ON THE PACKET AS HE FIND IT
140,THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONE BUT IT WAS JUST AS COOBLED THE CHARM TO ME
141,TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT WHO OF SHRANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOU WAS
142,HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
143,SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
144,SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
145,SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I EVER KNOWN AND HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHAT HAVE HER
146,POSTON SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WERE SURE I COULD SEE
147,RE EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
148,YOU ARE ACUTE
149,HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
150,I WILL LAY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
151,IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STUDY WILL STAY HE
152,CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
153,MISSUS GROPH AND HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR LITTLE MORE LIKE
154,WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORYATE WON'T TELL SAID DUGLESS NOT AND ANY LITTLE VULGARLY MORE THE PITY THEN
155,ONE YOU TELL DUDLAS
156,FOR HOW IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
157,LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MAID MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
158,POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HARSH LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
159,THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAID DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF A ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN NO RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED AS UP
160,THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TAIL AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
161,HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE OF BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHAKES BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AND OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSENCE THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
162,THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
163,THEY WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
164,I DON'T ANTICIPATE
165,SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIDE NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES IN LITTLE COMPANY FOR REALLY GREAT LONELYNESS
166,HE HAS BUT THAT JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
167,IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
168,IT SOUNDED DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS NAME CONDITION WHICH WAS
169,SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISPARNED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THINKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT HER WOUNDED
170,PUT IT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF LADIES ASKED
171,HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
172,GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCEND OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESS TO SOUL IN HEAVEN
173,YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER AND LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
174,THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY CO EXISTENCE WITH THOUGHTLESS BEAUTY IT'S A TIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GUARD THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
175,THIS OUTWARD MUTEABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTYS OF HER IN HER LIFE
176,HAS JERK COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PERIL WAS IMBYING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
177,THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PARLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
178,HASTERPRIEND NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ARRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDOCIVARYITY
179,MY FULL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
180,AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER A DRESS TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT ROLLED THE MOMENT
181,IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET IN ITS SEGIBLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HASTER COULD NOT HOW QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
182,BEHOLDING IT ESTHER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ALF AND THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO A SHORE
183,BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS ABOUT TO SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULAR THEE IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
184,PARROW WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
185,PEROL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
186,IF SPOKE UNTIL SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
187,HAS SIR PRINCE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLING HIM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FURNCHED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WARNED ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE BORE THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THE FORMER REBELORAL OR TO DESCEND TO DESCEND A STUP
188,ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF THE BOARDED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
189,AT THAT EPOCH OF PROCEEDING SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHT OR PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF OUR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HASTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
190,THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSE A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF
191,WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXORIA AND BEAUTY HAVE BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY A CANOE
192,IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER AND ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER AND DOUBT WITH LIFE
193,THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS A SWOON DID SWARM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SEMELITUDO'D WAVING MANY HOURS OF MORE BIT INGENUITY TO CREATE AN AN AN AN ANOLOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER OBJECT OF HERBERT AND THE HOUR'S OF MORE BED ENDURE OF MORE BED ENDURIANT AND THE HOUR'S ENJOY IT AND THE HOUR'S ENJOYMENT INJUSTING THE HOUR'S OF MORE BEDROOM AND THE HOUR'S OF MORE BIT OED INCOY TO AN INGEN TO AN INGEN
194,BUT IN TRUTH BORROW WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDEA HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
195,COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUCH AT THEM
196,BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAWNLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE NOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
197,SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
198,IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CAPITALISTIC FIGURES AND DIETIGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCKLE WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DOORABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
199,THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCH TO FORM AND FLANK ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE NOT AS WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM THAT NEED
200,LEIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HAS TO PRAY DEVICE SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BONDS BONDS A FREE BORN ENGLISH MAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
201,YES HAS HONORABLE WISH UP HIS WITHIN BUT HE HATH THEY GODDLY MINISTER OR TO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
202,YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
203,WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLING HIM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIRESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
204,ON THE TABLE AND TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PUTOR TANKER TANKER AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HADSTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RAFT OF ALE
205,LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FONTAS OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
206,MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK NO
207,AND TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
208,PROLL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE DISTANCE OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVE AND GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME ROOT AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERING
209,BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RUINED WISH AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
210,THERE WERE A FEW ROSES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVER INTO MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLE OR OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MET THE LOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDE THROUGH OUR EARLY ANIMALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL
211,PERALL SAYING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PASSIFIED
212,HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLOOM NEPANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE ROUGHLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BROODED WITH GOLD
213,HIS HEAD HAD A PEAKED CROWNED THE FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE ROOM WAS THE ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THE TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
214,INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WERE BOOTS WITH TURN OVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE CODE HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
215,FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF AWE'S IN WHICH THEY LIVED
216,WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE ONLY LATCH THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
217,NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANY ONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
218,AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE LONDON FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICKENS THE PATH DIVIDED
219,HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
220,ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNCOMMON UDO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD LUNCH IN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
221,THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIP
222,UNC NOT TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL LIMB BLUE OPEN IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
223,I AM MY DEAR AND OLD STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
224,WE'VE COME FROM A FIRE ONLY YOU PLACED IN THIS OH THE YOUR PLACE
225,AND YOU MUST BE OVER THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
226,OH DO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
227,WE ARE TRAVELLING REPLIED OLD JO AND WE STOP THE DEAR HOUSE JUST YOUR RESTING REFRESH OURSELVES
228,THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
229,IT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOGS WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBLINI STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
230,IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARK A LOT WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
231,YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARK A LOT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAMMA BE THE WITCH WHO TO LEAVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLICANS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
232,THE FIRST LOT WE TEMPTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
233,I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HARD FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MYS IN THEY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
234,I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF US
235,YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ON MY LIFE WITHOUT KNOWN HE THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
236,THAT IS ONE REASON KNEW OR ILL THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN INSIMITED TONE
237,I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCH WORK GIRL SAID MAR GIRL LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
238,BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH A HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
239,YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
240,A BED QUILT MADE A PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SO TOGETHER
241,SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLOURS ARE SO MIXED UP
242,WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FROM MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLORS WOULD DISCOURTE HER FROM TIME TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUCHIONS ARE
243,AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCES OZ MULAVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
244,I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
245,OH YOU WOULD EXAMINE THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
246,MARGALLAD HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRLS FORMED FROM THE PATCH WERE QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THROUGH OUT
247,THE HEAD OF THE PATCH WORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
248,THE HAIR WAS OF BROWNYARDEN HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK AND SEVERAL NEAT BRADES
249,GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON NED LAND OF AWE AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
250,NO I EVER GOT OUT TO BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
251,WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARLOCK BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS AS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH IN MIGHTY AND FIELD ABOVE HER WORK
252,SHE POURED INTO THE DISHONITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
253,I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
254,SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR CANDLES FROM THE FIRE
255,THEIR CONTENTS HAD A HORRIBLE WAY LEAVING THE BOTTOM OF EACH CATTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
256,VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALL TOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DIS WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
257,NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME THAT TO THE CUPBOARD
258,OH TO BE CAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE IN SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
259,HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BATTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
260,MOST PEOPLE TAUGHT TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
261,I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOK AND STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
262,THE WISDOM OF OURS WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND UNTOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS NEARLY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SOURCES
263,IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
264,I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUE ARE IN MY GARDEN
265,DO ME ONE OF CHATEAUXTER GETTING TO BEANK OR MARKED THEM ADDITION WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
266,AS THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
267,THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CREATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
268,THE EDICT OF MALIGN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
269,BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VILATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR AND BY THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SEX WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
270,CONSTANTING EITHER LEAVE THAT THE HERITICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN
271,SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EATICS OF DIPLATION AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
272,THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALL BOTH WITH EXALTATION THAT THE APPESTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT IN SKISM AND THAT THE PARAGANS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BLETEENTH
273,BUSHES VERDIONS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE CANYON OF THE DOMITORS
274,PROSCRIED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DAUNTEST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY INIMITY OF THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIME IT
275,SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACT OF SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATES WILD RECESSES
276,THE DEUCE WERE SUFFERED TO EXALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHUTTING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
277,AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HACKY WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
278,HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A REVIEW THAT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
279,DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHICAGO FOR FREQUENT AND EARNEST
280,YET HERE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCORENS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
281,LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
282,SHE GOT COOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
283,THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND RED THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
284,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING
285,SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
286,IF A ROCK OR RIVALLET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON ENDEAVOURED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVER THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
287,EXTING WISHED HANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWS BY THE HORSES
288,A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGEMENT FOR HIS PORTION
289,THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
290,THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOISTOLUTION
291,RUNBACKLES AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
292,NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HACKY HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
293,IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERE TO HIS OWN
294,IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPULSED FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BALMS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKIPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
295,THERE WERE SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND THE MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
296,THE INGENIOUS OCCUPY WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
297,THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
298,CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
299,COME COME RETURNED HIGH AND CASEING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE HAS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN IN THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED
300,THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
301,I GREATLY MORE THAN ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
302,THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MEDIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
303,THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
304,FOR A FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WEARIED BUT CLOSE OBSERVED THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
305,DELYIVERED AN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT I ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE AND WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS IN AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
306,THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTION TO THE SUPPOSED CONCURATE TO ENTER
307,BUT THE BEAR AND STEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT AT TAKING AND GROWLED
308,THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TO CONTINUE DAVID AND PROVEING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FOR THEIR OFF
309,THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THIS OUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
310,IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED ONLY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY
311,UNCUS OCCUPIED A DISTANCE CORNER AND HER CLINING ATTITUDE BEING REGULARLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHS
312,THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAINLY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
313,WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MING GOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGER IS GOOD AS NOTHING
314,THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUT STRIPPED THE DEER
315,UNCUS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECORD AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
316,BUT HACKY WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO KNOW THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF INTO HIS COMPANION
317,SO AND KISS YOU'D BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
318,WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CERTAIN
319,AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
320,MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NET HOLD IT SO DIRECT AND A TACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
321,IF YOU'RE NOT THEN NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NONSENSE A REPUTATION AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DINE YOUR BED
322,SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARA HERE
323,BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLEED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
324,KEEPS SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE IN IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHININGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
325,IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCAL AS I TRUST IN BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNGUESS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOME TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
326,HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
327,THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE HAD IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTICE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS ABROAD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
328,GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SEND IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING A TERITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS IN THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
329,THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
330,WILL THE HERONS HERE HIS GROANS
331,THE MOST HE CAN START IT ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAVING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTER FITTED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
332,HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
333,UNCUS CASSED AS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
334,I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
335,I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
336,MY FRIENDS TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
337,WITHOUT HIS SCRAPOX HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY AND TIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
338,I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
339,I WAS ABSENT ANOTHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
340,THE ONLY DUKE AT WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNOSTOR A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
341,THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUBBAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
342,THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
343,THEY'LL TURN OUT WAS THAT SOME ONE PASSING HAD A OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
344,I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY LEFT HIM COLLAPT AND A CHAIR WILL I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
345,A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
346,NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DULL OR PLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE THOUGHT US DID
347, ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
348,TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
349,DID ANY ONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
350,I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
351,SO IT SEEMS TO ME
352,NOW MISTER SONES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
353,ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
354,THAN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIP TOE WITH HIS NECK CRANE HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
355,THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAIN SAID OUR LEARN TO GOD
356,I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNED HERE SAID HE
357,ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
358,YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
359,THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
360,AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOULS FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
361,HOW LONG WITH A TAKEN TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION NO QUARTER NOW OR NOT LESS
362,THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
363,HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
364,MISTER SAW MISS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
365,ALMS HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS AND THEN AND THE SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
366,WHAT'S A N I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AND JUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
367,I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THEN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISH SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
368,AS HOMES THROUGH THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND AN A LERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
369,ALMS TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALLO WHAT IS THIS
370,WHOM'S HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
371,WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
372,I UNDERSTAND TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USED THE STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
373,AND THERE ALL IN FOR THE EXAMINATION YES
374,ONE HOT THE LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
375,LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
376,MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT TO VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND AN INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
377,THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MOUSE MC CLARON
378,I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST SUNLIGHTLY
379,HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
380,BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
381,DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
382,HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR

390,THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
391,NO NAME'S PLEASE SAID HOMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILLKER
392,OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY INCURIOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCE AS RATHER SUSPICIOUS
393,THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOMES
394,YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
395,TO MORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION
396,I CAN'T ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED
397,IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE AN OPPOSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
398,I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BY

412,HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLDS WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUT STRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
413,YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
414,IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL
415,NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT

438,IF MISTER SONES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP
439,IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETY HER DEFEND SO THE FIFTEEN THE MEN HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM

474,ABILE EVEN THE TRAINING IN A FEEBLE TO THEIR TASK CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HARDLY SECONDED HIM
475,BUT CRESTWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFLES IN NO MOMENTS THEY BETWEEN RACES
476,THE BAND OF POOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSINCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GREY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMITTED THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMIT IT TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH OCCASIONALLY LOGICKE MULATHED
477,WHILES A TAVE ME HEROIC ADDED CROSS WELL AVOIDING HIS SISTERS EYES
478,WHAT WE ARE NOT HER EXACTLY WELCOME
479,MARY TALE HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZOUR TO MISSUS GRACE PRIVATE YEAR LATER
480,FOOTCHINATEDLY SAID MISTER VANDU REVOVENNOS AND SAW THEIRS ALL RAVING OUT OF BANNAH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS
481,HE KNEW THE SOBER FLEECE HIS AND SORROWS MUST BE RUINED
482,IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF A COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT
483,AH THE SWAT THE CRUIS HALF
484,THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTENED SLOWLY TO LET FLAME LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN BURNING WONDER
485,HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW OR NO AND CARE NOT O KER CARE AND KNEW NOT
486,SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE
487,WHO WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISS
488,THEN IT WAS SUDDEN THAT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STOOD THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAM
489,WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING
490,THE LUGUD HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DITES A WEEK AGO AND NOW
491,PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING
492,HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY
493,HE SPLASHED TO STAMP THE LONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEAR THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE
494,THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY
495,HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF ALL OF GREEN THICK TALL WET IN WILLOUGHLY
496,THIS COURSE OF COTTON SHARP AGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOURCE
497,BUT ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID A GATE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THENLY AGAINST THE TREE
498,HE GAZED ABOUT WOULD COLLECT A ASTONISHED
499,HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK IN PAINS SOME ONE HAD DUG A NAIL FROM THE GLOOM TO THE GREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DREENED BY LONG AND COOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY
500,HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORROW
501,THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN
502,THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND
503,UP AND THE SICK ROOMS OR LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED
504,THE NED AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED IN DOME SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROLL FOR HER LIFE WAS GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEEKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTIONED
505,FOR WHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE AT SON IN BIRD AND TREE
506,SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHER THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TUMULACE SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD INTO THE SWAMP
507,SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITH IN ITS BORDERS WITHIN HIS BORDER SHE HAD LIVED IN GROAN AND WITH IN ITS BORDER SHE HAD MET HER LOVE
508,ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LOW THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER
509,THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW
510,HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND TOSSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE
511,IT IS A VERY FINAL PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PAIL POWDERY LIKEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP
512,THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PAINS AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED
513,FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERY LACKY WHO HAD GUESSING HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR
514,A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEASES OF WOLES STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS
515,AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW
516,SEVERAL CLOSE HORSES A BRILLIANT AS BINNING WHEEL IN AN OLD BOX WHIT OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
517,AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THEIR EYES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION IS CONCERNED BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK'S SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE
518,THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW
519,BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER REIGN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTNING UP EVERY PATCH OF A GREEN MOSS AND THE RED TALES OF THE CAD
520,WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MANY THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE WOOD ALWAYS SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH A LATEST TREADING GASE OF
521,HAD HE SURREAL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AND THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE
522,DUNITES A POST HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH AND HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN ATE IN THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPENED LIGHT FOOTED
523,THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE THAN A MORRIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DYNNAES SURREFICT GENTLEMANS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA IN MERRY
524,HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE IN WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITH A YOUR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LUCTURE AS A BARREL ORGIN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
525,THE FACT THAT IT WAS TURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WID US AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MELANCHOLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY
526,TO ALL APPEARANCE MALLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXAMPLERY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DISPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIBLY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TO MILKING TIME
527,SPRONING INDEED

541,TADDY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND IN A MOUNT OF FAT ON THE KNEE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PAID
542,AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TWO AND RACHEL
543,I OFTEN HEARD A TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
544,WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAN ILLNESS AND I WAS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU'LL HAVE A FRIEND UNEARTH IN YOUR AUNT RACHEL IF I'M TAKEN FOR YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I'M SURE I FOUND IT SO
545,AND THERE'S LINEN IN THE HOUSE IS I COULD WELL SPARE YOU FOR I GOT LOTS OF SHEATING AND TABLE CLOTHING INALINGS IS AN MADE UP

548,WE CAN ALL BE SERVANTS OF GOD WHATEVER OUR LOT IS CAST BUT HE GIVES US DIFFERENT SORT OF WORK ACCORDING AS HE FITS US FOR IT AND CALLS OF TO IT
549,I COULD NO MORE HELP SPENDING MY LIFE IN TRYING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOULS OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUNNING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TATTY CRYING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR ENDANGE
550,I'VE STRONG A STRONG ASSURANCE THAT NO EVIL WILL HAPPEN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE IN THE CHILDREN FOR MANY THING I HAVE DONE

566,BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT THAN I DO SIR
567,I THINK I SHOULD BE DOING YOU A SERVICE TO TURN YOU OUT OF SUCH A PLACE
568,I KNOWS HARM IS IN BETTER ORDER THAN ANY OTHER WITHIN TEN MILES OF US AND AS FOR THE KITCHEN HE ADDED SMILING I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ONE IN THE KINGDOM TO BE IT
569,I THE BYE I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR DAIRY HIM A SERIOUS VOICEER
570,THIS MISER SAID BLUSHING AND BELIEVING THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN HER MILK PANES AND WOULD ADJUST HIS OPINION OF HER TO THE APPEARANCE OF HER DAIRY
571,OH I HAVE NO DOUBT ITS ENCAMPLE ORDER
572,THE PARIS PLAN LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT
573,THE LONDON BLACK WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS JURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS AND THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VITAL
574,THERE MONSIEUR'S JOHNSON AND HAMMER A PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE EYE AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
575,THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE IN THOSE SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VERY IN SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTING VIEWS INTO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS
576,OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE AND DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSEAL PROPHETABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMORS AT A CYNASTON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS WELL
577,WHY IF WE ERECTATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
578,THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE
579,BROUGHT AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE AND THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS HIDEOUS AND GRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
580,EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HIS BEEN AIM THAT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE
581,FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRANTS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY
582,IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR A LETTER BLADING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE OVER ITS BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
583,BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUPPER A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FAR MOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENTS IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
584,EDISON WAS IN TOLERANT OF SHAMEN AND SHOTS AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MYR SKOPE TEST TOO AND GAUVELIN ON HER
585,ON LESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULARLY THE NOSE OF BATTLE FOR HIS DINIMO AND LAP ADD A CYNRIELIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STUDY LIKE
586,MISTER ADISON WAS A LEADER FAR A HAT OF THE TIME
587,HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION BREAK ALSO REGULAR SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATED A VERIFIED
588,THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBBERCADE AN ENGINE FOR CONTAINY WAS RUNNING AND MISTER ADAMS IN FORM ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT THE YORKE AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSE
589,ADVOUSIN HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATIONS SYSTEM IN THE MORT ON THE MULTIBLE ARCH SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEATURE AND MADE INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTOR'S AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TWO WARS
590,HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
591,THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDICE IN SYSTEM UNDER THE STRAND YOU WAS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS AN ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND A GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDISTENT LIGHTING
592,IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAD ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN THE YIELD OF SECTS OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSEBOWER WAS CONSIDER SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
593,THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD FULL LINE CONSTRUCTION AT WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADJUSTMENTED TO BUILD ANY QUEP CENTRAL STATIONS
594,MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WORCES TO KNOW AN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ELLISON BEING INDEPENDENT IN VENERS AT PRACTICAL THE SAME TIME
595,I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAT I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDITION CONSTRUCTION TO PARDON AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
596,BUT THE POLITE RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRES STATIONED IN THIS COUNTRY
597,THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE BISHOPITION AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF AT A SONYA BUT THEY REMAINED IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS ONE INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
598,THE ARCH LAMP AND STALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMERS FROM HIS OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBDIG TO REBADE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP
599,AT US AND HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
600,THERE WAS INFINITE SCAPTICISM WERE ROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT VERY THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANY THING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WADE
601,HENCE THE EDITION ELECTROLETIC METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
602,THE PRINCIPAL EMPLOYED IN THE EDITION ELECTROLITTAKER IS THAT WHICH EXAMPLE FINDS THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSED A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
603,A SO SEATED WITH THE SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS IN GENIUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM AN ACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DENMAGE
604,THE STANDARD AT A SENATOR PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE AMONG TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SAT BEING SUBSTITUTED
605,IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER DUBBUD YOU J JENKS RED INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF A LECTICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THEN
606,THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN AN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DAVID AND BASES
607,IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ATISON ILLUMINATING COMPANY'S IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS YOU NATURALLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE ATHAGEM EATER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FORCEDATIONS OF ONE THOUSAND LIKE
608,THE MAJOR CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
609,HE WADED AND REALLY THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
610,HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
611,THE PROBLEM WAS SOUGHT
612,WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
613,WE HAD METERS IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
614,HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SO THE AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICSATICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SENTCEPOLY SPHERS DRAUGHTROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
615,EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE OURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMORIST A MAN'S OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
616,THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
617,SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
618,IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE FRANZIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
619,OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID MAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED

637,HE CRIED AND HIGH JUDGMENT JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
638,AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD THE BURST OUT INTO A SERIOUS OF SHORT HAPPY BITES OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
639,AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM UNWIPED HIS FACE VIVUOUSLY

727,FIT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REP TILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESSION
728,TWO MONSTERS ONLY RECREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO RIPPED HOUSE OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
729,I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE ASSURUS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COE AND HIS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
730,IT'S DRAW IS A NORMOUS AND ACCORDING THE NATURALIST IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
731,THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH A GREATEST AND EMOSSITY
732,SUDDENLY THE IT THE ASSURATES AND THE PLENTY OF SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WARPOOL ETIEN IN THE WATER
733,AS FOR THAT IF THE ASSURUS HAS HE RETURNED WHO SUBMERING CAVERN
734,THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
735,THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG
736,THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPOURS PROVIDED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPRATION OF SAILING WATERS
737,THE ELECTRIC LIGHT AND SCARCELY PENETRATE TO THE DANCE CURRENT WHICH IS DROPPED OF A THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
738,THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
739,FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEET LEFT OF MISS WE YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT CROSSED DOWN UPON THE DANCE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OVAIC AND A PENETRABLE MASS
740,THE ATMOSPHERE AS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SEARCH WITH ELECTRICITY
741,THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HEDGE RESOLVE OR A FEARFUL WINDY GUESTS AND RUSHING STORMS
742,THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINT POINTING TOWARDS THE HER EYES IN
743,THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
744,ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A LAMIN SINKLES FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL KETCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE SHEEP OF A LAD
745,BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CATCH US AS A MOMENT
746,THAT WILL BE THE SAFEEST NO NO NEVER
747,THE PILED OF VAPERS CONTENTS IN A WATER AND THE AIR PUT IN A VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACANT LEFT BY THE CONVERSATION OF THE MIST ROSES ITSELF INTO A WORLD WHEN
748,HARN STIRS NOT
749,FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS INCONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MALICULES THE GASHES ELEMENTS OF THE AIR ANY TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR A NEARABLE COLUMNS OF WATER
750,I REFERRED TO THE THERMOMETER IT IN A CASE THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
751,IS THE ATMOSPHERE CONDITION HAVE IN ONCE REACHED A STUDY TO BECOME FUNERAL
752,THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
753,AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
754,EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
755,THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
756,THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
757,HE GODS HIS CONSENT
758,THE FAR BALL HALF OF IT WHY HALF AZER BALLOON AND THE SIZE OF A TENT CHILL MOVED SO ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH A ASTONISHING PHILOSOPHY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
759,HERE COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THAT'S IT LIGHTLY LEAVES ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BROWN AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZIE HORRIBLE
760,WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHTNING LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHED HIS HANDS WHO FIX HIS BLUE EYE UPON ITS STEADILY IT THREATS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
761,A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NATURED FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERED THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LANKS
762,WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
763,AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
764,POOR ALICE
765,IT WAS THE WHITE RAVEN RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED THE PAIR WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING A LONG AND A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
766,OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
767,ALICE TOOK THE MAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TODAY
768,AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
769,I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
770,I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
771,I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
772,I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE
773,HOW CAREFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEEDLY SPREAD HIS CAUSE AND WELCOME THE LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
774,NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
775,IT WILL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SANG COME UP AGAIN DEAR
776,I'M SO VERY TIRED TO BEING ALL ALONE HERE
777,AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
778,I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWIM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
779,I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWN IN MY OWN TEARS
780,THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
781,I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O MOUSE
782,CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
783,WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE AND DEED
784,WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISHED SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHERS FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
785,THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TO TALK AMERICAN STREAM MIND HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER ANNE OR OUTSIDE THE LIE THROUGH CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LONGER AND MUST WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICAN
786,LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON COLLISIONS
787,THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME A PRESS OF
788,IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
789,THE WORD HAD TO BE CONVINCED
790,OR IT SHOULD NOW BE SET ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY AND GLATIONS
791,MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING IN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPOSE ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GLATIONS FOR INSTANCE
792,IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LIE THROUGH ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIONS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
793,IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHERS WRITING THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUST OF THE CYNOR FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
794,BUT THE ESSENCE OF LOATURES IS THERE
795,THE LORD WAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO BLUE TOO
796,THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER
797,IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT UNDER MINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
798,THEY SAID TO THE GOATIONS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
799,HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN THE CHRIST
800,PARK HIM LATER IN HIS BENEATH US
801,INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
802,DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW WORTH WRITICS WOULD THISONE HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
803,AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSSES PROBABLY DEFENCE HIS EPISTOLIC AUTHORITY IN MINISTRY
804,AS THE AMBASSADOR OF GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXAL HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN A AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
805,POLTING'S PRIDE HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PHRASE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
806,POLL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
807,IT OF HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR A CAUSE THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND OF HOSTS
808,POLL THE CLAIRS OF THE FALSE POSSUMS WERE CALLEDMEN EITHER BY MEN NOR BY MEN
809,THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
810,HE MENTIONED THE APOSTLE'S FIRST BECAUSE THERE WERE APPOINTED TO RECK THE BY GOD
811,THE CALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
812,FOR PERSON THE POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
813,IS SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
814,WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
815,I DID NOT THEN REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
816,I KNOW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE A FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTERED THAT A CERTAIN AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
817,THIS IS NO CYNFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE
818,IN GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
819,THE CLASPING SUPERVOLOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
820,THESE PERVERTIS OF THE RIGHTSENESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SUN AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
821,IN THIS WHOLE PISTOL PALL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
822,BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST ONE THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN AND FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
823,FRESH TO
824,AND ALL THE BREATH ROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME
825,THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUSE OF THE FALSE APPLES
826,ALL THO THE BRETHREN WITH ME AND NOT APOSTS LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK RIGHT AND CREATURES I DO
827,THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMYS OF THE GOSPOWLS PRODUCING THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
828,QUIRED THEN ON INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACHED THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD
829,WE LOOKED FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
830,NOT ALL THE RELATIONS HAD BECOME PERVERTED
831,THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
832,THEY REMAINED DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
833,WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTIQUIST MEANS THERE
834,SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE PISTOL NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE OPPOSITION FIRST THREE
835,GRACE BE TOO IN PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
836,THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
837,THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLES REPRESSION
838,GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SENSE PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
839,THE WORLD RENDS THIS SUPPINISIOUS DOCTRINE
840,EXPERIENCE PROVE THIS
841,HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
842,MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
843,WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
844,TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALSO TOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES IN TOLERABLE WHEN WE SEE TO MEASURE IN THE COMPREHEND HIS INFANT MAJESTY
845,HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUISEIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASS AN UPON HIM
846,IM BRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
847,DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH IN THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
848,WHEN YOU ARE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
849,WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS ARE DIVINE TEACHER
850,AT THE SAME TIME PALCONS ARE CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
851,THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS A PARENT IN THAT POLESCRIBED HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO THE SPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
852,TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
853,OTHERWISE PALL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PIECE FROM A LORD JESUS CHRIST
854,THE ARIONS TOOK PRICE FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURES SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
855,MAMID ALSO SPEAK HIGHLY OF CHRIST
856,POSTICS TO HIS THEM
857,HE NEVER LOSE HIS SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS OPINION
858,NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PATUAL LANDS OR IN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
859,NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR A GOODNESS BEFORE SINS
860,UNDER SCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCE
861,HOW MAY WE OBTAIN A MISSION OF OUR SINS
862,POLLY ANSWERS THE MAN WAS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR A SENSE
863,SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS AT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
864,THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINED OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLETON
865,THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SUM OF GOD INDICATES THIS
866,THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR INSTANCE
867,BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
868,WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK REMEMBER WE CAN THE SMITH
869,THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MANNER SOLDANTER SIN
870,THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES IN TO GO WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OURSELVES
871,THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
872,BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
873,ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
874,HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS IN THE NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND THUMBERS TO PERUSENCE FROM THE HEAVENS TO MEN FROM A STRONBING TO PHYSICALITY HE CONFUSED US A RECTOR THIS NOT THE STING WHICH
875,THE INFLUENCE WHICH STOOD TO ME AS HAS EXERCISE UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
876,INTO SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALLT THE NEW PLATINIST'S FOUND HAD AN GENUSIONS AND CONNEXIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SISTERS AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUIET AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATEAU
877,THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UTTERED THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECTRIOUS AGAIN HIM HIS EFFORT TO REALIZE IN CONNEXIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
878,THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENT TEACHERS OWNED TO ME AS FALLING SHOULD YOU ABSURD IT HE'S UP IN YOUR PLANEST
879,IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT THE LAWS OF HER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HIS CHIEF THOUGHT
880,THE FANCIES OF THE NEW PLANISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A FEES OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN CUREA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXAINT IN OUR OWN DAY
881,BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATEIL AND INSISTED THE ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
882,WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLAYED A WOOD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOCKS WERE WEVERTED A THOUGHT OF WHAT RANGING ANY OF HIM BESIDES A TRUIDS WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
883,THE DIAL UP IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THISVES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
884,BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FINE THIS INTIMATED TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOME WAY BETWEEN MEDICINE AND METHODICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN WRINKING THE FURS OF FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE
885,WITH HER ACCLITOUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUPS WHITE AND EXAGGEROUS HE ASSERTED THE PREDONENTS OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF THE CESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING BY THE PSYORIANS HE SUPPOSE THE MIZES THE PROPOSIS
886,MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRISCILLA'S PHILOSOPHY ARE ENCLUDED INTO TINGEOUS
887,IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
888,THE IDEAS OLD TO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN AND EMBO'S BIRDS'S FISHES
889,THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE T WAR IS THE FOR GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE POLITICAL SILENCE
890,BUT SWAYEDO HAS NOT THE SAME MYSTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR COMPOSING HIM
891,NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF INTRODUCTION IN WHICH THESE USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED OF MANNER
892,BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
893,HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POLLET OR THE LOSS OF HER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
894,AND HENCE WE FIND A SAME SORT OF PLUMSINESS IN THE TENAYOS OF PLATEAU WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE FILLS OFF GOREEN OF LUCRETIOUS
895,THERE IS A ONE OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF OPPOSITION IN MORE OF REPETITION THAN A CURS IN PLATEALS EARLY OR WRITINGS
896,PLAYED TILL HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORD
897,SO READY BEGINNSTIT TO ME AS WITH A SOMERY OF THE REPUBLIC
898,AND THOU HAD DESIRE TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIGHT TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
899,IN THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LARKAS WAR AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER IN A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIUS WHOM ALL A VENGEANCE NO TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED INTO HER MOTIVES WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE
900,I WILL IF TO ME AS A PROOFS I AM RUTH
901,LIZEN THEN SO PRETTYS TO A TALE OF SOLIDS WHO BEING OF FRIEND OF TROPEETUS MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER PRETTY IS AND HE TOLD ME
902,SOMETIMES OF SOLEMN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
903,AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POET SAID THE PERSON WILL MADE THE REMARK
904,THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HAD THE CRY OF THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE INDIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
905,BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE WAFTS OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
906,TALL THIS SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY IN WHICH SOLAN HEARD THIS MORNING
907,BUT IN EACH IT THE TRADITIONS OF HER OWN AND OTHER LIMBS ARE BY THOSE REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLE
908,THE GENIALOGIES WHICH HAVE RECITED TO CHULPUS OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNE ALSO IN YOUR CHILDREN STORY
909,FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD AT THINGS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
910,SOLEN MARVEL AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULAR
911,NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE SHE FOUNDED YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE YOU FOUND IT OURS AS ARE ANIMAL TO RECORD
912,MANY LAWS EXISTS A MODEST WHICH HAD THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE ODIN TIME
913,I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HIM TO YOU IN IS SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AS TRUE IN THE STATE REDRESSORS
914,OBSERVED AGAIN WHAT CHIRRED ALLOWED TO IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD IN APPLYING THEM TO THESE OF MEN
915,THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHREW OF THE ISLAND OF A TWENTIS
916,FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE AUTUMNALIAN HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPAILED IN FEATURE AND OFFER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATION WITHIN THE PILLARS
917,THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLLES WE SHALL HAVE FOUND IN THAT HARD OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
918,BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
919,THEN THOU LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TO ME AS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MEN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED
920,BUT ALREADY AT POINT AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION FAR AND TAKING THE EMUDGEANCE OF THE LADY SPECIALISED CONSUMPTION OF A GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECULIAR STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
921,THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSES A DREAM OF GIRLS
922,SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALSEHOOD THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT TO CONSUMPTION TO THEIR OWN CONFIDEMFULNESS OF LIFE
923,WITH A FURTHER ADVANCED AND COUNTER THIS TO BOOM HAD CHANGED IN SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE HERE AT GOLD BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TO BO OR A LARGE MELODY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEMES
924,IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE LEISURE CLASS
925,AND WERE THE TOBOO SAID IN VICTUALS AND RAPIDLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR TAS
926,GRINCUNKENESS AND THE OTHEROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMINENCE THEY HAVE ATTENDED TO BECOME UNREFICK AS BEING A MOCK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR ESTATES OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
927,IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASE CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS POST INTO EVERY DAY SPEECH AS A SYNONY FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
928,THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUCENTS HIS ACCUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE CONFIT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
929,WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL ROOF IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONCEIVE ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
930,THE OBJECTION OF COARSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOWCILE PERFRINEILIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SECRET THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE ABBUS THAN SUSANCIAL
931,THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF COMMON VALET HE AND RELIGION THESE MOUNTAINEVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATE TO DEVELOPMENT THE THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SO MOTIVES
932,THERE IS A MORE OR LESS A SEPARATE SYSTEM OF RANKIN GRATES
933,THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHER BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF DENTY
934,MANY OF THESE AFFULATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESS AMEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THE ROMAN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM MUST GUESSED OLD OTHERS ONLY PASHLY TO BE RIGHTED AS I CARE AS CONSUMACY AS
935,SOME MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THEIR ATTAINER AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CAUSED AS MY CARE IS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
936,MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER OURSAL CRUCERY HAVING TURNED A TOUCH TO THE PERSONS AND MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF I CARE AS CONSUMER IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR WIFE'S CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS AT CETERA
937,THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS A LIVERY SYMPATHIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MOCK OF SAVAGE REEL ARE SENSIBLE
938,THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERY'S MAY BE REFLECTED IN INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVICE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
939,BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT TO COUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
940,SO THOSE OF HIS WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER IMPROVEMENT OF THE LEISURE CHASANEBIL SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACUT REMONENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED THE SENSIBLY PREJAMENTS
941,I NEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MEANING ELSE OF SUGGESTION HAS TO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIME RAYMONDS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIES A REFLECTED ON A RIFIC CHARACTER
942,THE LIVERY BECOMES OF NOTIOUS TO NEED ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
943,AND A GENERAL WAIT THOUGH NOT WHOLLY IN ALL CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COULD SIDE
944,THE DEPENDENT TO US FIRST ELIGATE IT FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PHEASANTS BY HIM THESE DEDES ARE CAST MALLY PERFORM GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THEY LOST
945,BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WITH THE DEW TO SURVI CARESOLUTION DEVOURED UP ON THE WIFE ALONE
946,IN THE COMMUNITY OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWEST ALAS
947,IF YOU DO COME FOR HIS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FOR TWO TO SECONDS IF THERE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COME AND THEMSELVES THROUGH THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WAY SAID EFFORT
948,THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS THEORY AND INDEED COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCEND INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLIMS THE MAN AND PEASANTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CAES TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCE AS
949,VERY RICH OF SQUALOUR AND DISCOMFIT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST DRINK IT OR THE LOST PRETENCE OF PECULIAR DECENTIESCIES PUT AWAY
950,THERE IS NO CLASS A NO COUNTRY THAT AS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
951,THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT
952,EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DOING THE EARLIER STATE IS OF SOCIAL GROWTH
953,THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
954,IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICIOUS CONCEPTION AS COMPARED WITH THE MEASURE
955,IT IS ALSO A NATURAL THAT THE SUBSERVATIVE COMESIONS AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PASSIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN OBJECT OF THE INDIVIDUALS WIDEEST AND THE MILTON OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
956,COME SOME SIMPLY COMES A LODGE AT ELEMENT IN THE CENTRE OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
957,AND AMONG THE CONTRIBUTATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKE IN BY SAVING AND HOME FOOTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NABET GOSSIP SUFFICIENT TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PAPOOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
958,THERE IS ALTOGETHER TILL BILL OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND COMPENSITY OF WORKMEN
959,UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECT OF NEST FOR ADVISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICIOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DEVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMOTION PRETTY EVEN LEAVE BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
960,BUT THE ACTUAL COARSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PACE AT THE STOUGHT AND CAME TOALD ERANK FAIRERIMENT TO BUFFFUL CONSTRUCTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE CENTRE OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE I PEACEFUL COUCHOR
961,OTHERS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSED AS MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOR UPON PROJECTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHAT EVER IS OF HUMAN USE
962,ERE CONSOLATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING WILL CLIMEMENTS IS AFFECTED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN AND CONTRIBUTE UNTIL SEVEN SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMON IN NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIES UPTIC OF IMMEDIATELY RATION IMBALDED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE
963,THE SAILENT FEATURES OF THESE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
964,THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS SPANIATURE WHETHER OF GOOD SERVICE OR SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RENTS THE OBVIPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEN THE FAMOUS GOOD NAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
965,AS YOU SIN THE SPEECH OF EVERY DAY LIFE THE WOOD CARES AND UNDERSTOOD OF THEIR RECATION
966,THE USE OF THE WOOD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERMS THEREFORE IMPRISONED A PRECAUTATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SALT BY THE CONSTURE UNDER THIS CANNON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
967,BUT IT IS ANOTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TIME WAIST IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPELLED THAT OCCASION OF WHAT DISGUISE US WAS AWAKEFUL
968,IN STRICT ACCURACY HAD NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICIOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPANDAGE HER AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECULIAR COMPOSITE

1005,I WISH IT WERE A KER AGAIN BUT IT WOULD TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE INS STRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEIRELY
1006,MY EYES FILLED TEARS WHEN I CAN TRUST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE AND ALL EVENTS CERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLYNESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER HAVE A BREEDING
1007,IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SOLVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY HOT BED FOR SYNFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDED ON A NATION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO MY REFORM DIRECTION
1008,AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JOVOLA I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I A DOOR THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTISED HORRIBLY WRONG
1009,THE CHRISTMAS HOLITIES CAME AND SHE AND RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURE'S EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELED UP MORE OR LESS
1010,INDEED THERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WELL PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
1011,SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME AIR AND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPED ON A ICE AND SHE FELL HE WAS DARKENED NODS ON HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
1012,AND FORTUNATELY THE FACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD FOR THAT TIME AT SHE NOW LIES AT HER HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
1013,HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO HIGHER DECISION THE NARS AND THAT YOU ARE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD THAT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND
1014,AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARED DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
1015,I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TWO INTIMATE SOCIETY
1016,A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONCASE A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YOUR PICTURE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGEST SHOP IN HOARSE FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRICE AND NURSES AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TRIAL
1017,TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
1018,HERE HE IS AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
1019,THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
1020,TOGETHER THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY IN AGE
1021,AT TEA TIME THERE WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT TO A TOUCH BY ANY OF THE THREE
1022,SHE HAD ANOTHER WAIT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
1023,BUT AND HAD BEGAN TO SUFFER THIS BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WASH OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER OF DANGER AND HER YOUNG
1024,STON BANG'S IDEA FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UP RAIDED MISS TUBE FOR HER FANCY DID INDIFFERENCE TO AND STATE OF HEALTH
1025,STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ENDS DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
1026,I DON'T WHETHER BROWN WELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
1027,TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
1028,WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AND ILLUSTRIOUS NUMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
1029,IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO COURT TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
1030,MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR BY PRONINATION OF THE WORD SCHEVER WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED SCUREA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARAS
1031,HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA HALFWARD AND SPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
1032,SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMMODIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARRIVOL FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMMONITIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE
1033,SYLVIE I DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HERSELF LOVED COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR A SOOTONY'S PERIOD OR A SECURITY TOWARDS THE ACTUAL SISTERS
1034,TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARIANNE IN THE COMMITTEE OF MARAU AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE
1035,SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINTSERVOUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTIQUITION AND TOLLERANCY OF THE CLERGY AND GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND AT THE EARTH
1036,YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE YOU A TEN THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF FOR FORMING THE MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SILLY A DIES
1037,I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
1038,I HAD A NAME MY BELIEVE AND MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE
1039,I SHALL CALL YOU US FREE
1040,YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOR
1041,HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGED FOR I HAVE IT SO
1042,AT YOUR SERVICE SIR
1043,MADAME WHEN SONG BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES
1044,I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIER AT THE RATE OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER UNDER THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE MORE IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HAD NONE OF THE FOLIATE
1045,I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A LATER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES
1046,I TOWN TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD
1047,THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOKED LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM IN ITALIAN HE EATEN TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND A BLASTY OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
1048,I THINK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE
1049,I ADDRESS HIM IN A TALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WHISTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
1050,MY MARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECTLY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUID OF THAT ANCIENT RIDER
1051,I SEE A CROWD AND ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL IN LOOKING UP
1052,IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
1053,YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAE ROYALTY AROSE THE MOST EX ACT
1054,THAT IS TRUE BY DON'T GRE
1055,ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FELL
1056,IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE SET CAT
1057,IS IT BETTER THAN ANY GIRLS
1058,BUT TO HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE
1059,SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TOO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP THE HAVE HURST ENOUGH BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HURST ENOUGH WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS
1060,YOU ARE NOW AND THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHEREWITH CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER A GENUINE OR A FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELL GO OF INTELLIGENT TOWN TO PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND
1061,LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE COWS NOT STOP AND LESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MET BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH
1062,IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH A PROVO SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ITS CENTRE IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTIONATE THE AFFECTIONATE THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE NATION FOR THE NATION
1063,WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT FEEBLE OR ROI
1064,SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
1065,WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM I MY FORTUNE IT ENOUGH TO SEE YOU
1066,HE HIMSELF RECITED THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL
1067,FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPE SO YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS
1068,I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
1069,I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME IN CATIONAL AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULD MEET WITH THE TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM
1070,IARIES EYED IN THE MAWAIRY ROOTED AND DISPORT
1071,I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE
1072,HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WITH CELEBRATED FOR HIS WOULD HE RUBART HAZ AND HIS SOCIAL MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANY ONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST
1073,HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
1074,ON THE SIX OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAYS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
1075,ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AND INSIGNIFICANT SEAT HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
1076,IN SET OF BUT SIX REGULARLY ASSOCIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION THE MEMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
1077,IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF NINE AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGONIZED WORDS EACH WORD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLIMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRESTED ORGANIZATION
1078,THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS HOSTELITES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING A FOREIGN BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH
1079,NEVER AS HAD THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THIS SMALLEST OF ALL SEATS HAS A TAIN THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW IN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THIS WEEDS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY ARTIST'S WORM
1080,THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN AND DISSIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SOME NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSSOLATING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED
1081,THE BOOK MOMENT HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TO WARN THIS DARK SKINNED RENDENT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH THEIR EYES WENT IN THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES
1082,IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAYS NAMES WITH FAVOUR SAYING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
1083,THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF CURTLANDO HIL ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE IN HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
1084,TO THE SERVANT LATTER DAYS SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
1085,SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOME'S A MISERY AND INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTING BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPPELIER AMONG THE MYSTERIOUS
1086,THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURNED THE BEWAUG'S AFTER WE WERE GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED WARRANTATOR AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE METAPHYS HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE SECURES
1087,THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN DEADLY CARRICAL BY HUMANCRIB
1088,MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTER WERE DISPOSED THEMSELVES IN CALLED WELL COUNTY THEY WERE STANDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST
1089,A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY WARM AND FAMILIES ON SHOW CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHTH A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPPLESS SETTLERS AND WHICH HEARD A SCORE
1090,BITS THAT THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS ENTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY WERE SIGN THEREFORE ANY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNED IT A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY
1091,OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURED THE GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT
1092,A AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF AN ALBIENCES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND THE VAPHEL DWAR HAUNTED AND HOW TO LIKE BEATS AS THE EFFECT OF A WORLD A CREEP
1093,WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS AT THE MORMENTS
1094,AS THE ZEPPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE MISERY IS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCEY ARGUS MARIUS SIXTEEN THE EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
1095,IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISERY WITH GOVERNOR BOX AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INSIGHTY TWO IT APPEARS AGAINST THEM ORMENTS BY POLITICAL HATRED
1096,THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH
1097,BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL
1098,IT WAS THROUGH FLOCKS AT VICE THAT HE CAN'T ORDER THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH AUSTENCIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TWO REPRESS AND A LEGAL RENTAL REBELLION WHICH HAD FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THIS SUCCESS
1099,MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WHAT GOOD OR OPPORTUNITY COULD THEY HAVE WISHED
1100,ALL READY IN NORTH AND SOUTH WERE TALKED ITSELF WHY NOT SET UP ALSO A WEST
1101,THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH THOUGH EAST NO WEST THEY SAID POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS A LESSON DEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TOO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LAWYERLY RESPONDED DE FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THE COUNTRIES
1102,WHAT THE LATTER THEY SAINTS CALLS A LESS TILL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF SO LESS TO MARRIAGE MORALITY OF WISE WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AN ESSENTIAL
1103,WE BELIEVE IT A LITTLE RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED EVERY SANCTIFIED AND AUTHORIZATION SHOULD BE EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE
1104,IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE NIGHT YET TO FIND THE PLACE IN ME TO PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS
1105,AT THE INSECTION OF BORROW MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAYS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST ITS PRACTICE
1106,IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS IN THAT DAY WITH A PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING QUARREL MARRIAGE IN AND AS HAD BEEN BREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRAYER TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS HAD DEAD LETTER
1107,THAT OR LEGIS AND UNITED STATES ITS TURNIES IN UTAH WHO WERE NOT LOREMENTS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND IN THAT EQUACY
1108,THIS MEANT THAT FIRST A LEDGE MISDEMERE FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PEDILNEY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FIN OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE OF PRISONED FOR LIFE I FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURTS POWER TO INSIGHT
1109,BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BOUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBECCA DID DESERVE MEN WERE IMPRISONED UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DERATION
1110,THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT FACES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSCIOUS ATTENTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE
1111,THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY WILL THRILL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND AS SHE HAD IT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED AND ILLUSTRATED OF GREAT VALUE LYING IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVED HER
1112,AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON IT'S FIT NOW HE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN
1113,MAYLE LIKE ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER
1114,HE HAD PRETENSIED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS ON ACCOUNTS
1115,IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TWO
1116,IT'S BEEN ONLY TO WEEKS AND I'D BEEN HALF A TIME'S ALREADY
1117,DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MADE ALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY OUT INTO THE TOP OF THE HANDSOME AND WROTE HIS PAKE WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THEY'VE TAKEN TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1118,SHE SAVED HER HAND TOO SHE SAT HER BEST AND THE SECOND BACK
1119,HE'S BEEN WANTED TO MARRY HELD OF THESE THREE YEARS AND MORE
1120,SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY NOW
1121,I REMEMBER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME A CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING
1122,MADE HOLD OUT FOR HER CONSTANT SEE WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDERS SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINKLING THREW THEM
1123,HE'S A DAUGHTER WAS AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1124,SO HOW IT TOWN MISTER PORTRA ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER
1125,I SAY SAID HARRIED A LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMILY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1126,YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE OF BIT CONSCIOUS TO NIGHT BUT A FIRST TIME
1127,WHILST MERELY WERE BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT IN WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UN CERTAIN OF HERSELF
1128,ALREADY A TASK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1129,HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL IT KEEN INTEREST IN THE SLENDER FERFOT DON QUIXOTE WHO SLIT IN AND OUT OF THE PLAY SAYINGING LIKE SOME ONE WHINDY WITH WHOM HEALED
1130,ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WHITTERED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WHILE WE STUDYING A BROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN THE TICKULAR AND THE ESTHER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
1131,SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NO I THINK NOT BUT WHY AM GLAD YOU ASK ME
1132,AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUAL INDIFFERENT
1133,OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING ODDLY WILD AND DEATH
1134,SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THEATER AGREED DOWN MORE THAN SHE USED TO
1135,ON GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SENSE
1136,AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY KNOWN
1137,I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH MORROW
1138,HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR
1139,THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM AND SHELL SEE AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HELD HER
1140,LAM WOULDN'T CARE GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY
1141,WHEN BARLEY ARRIVED AT BUT FOR SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UP STAIRS
1142,I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MALLY HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE A ENGLISH COOKERY

1231,WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOME TIMES IT COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST IS SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED IN FULFILLED MERITS
1232,WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
1233,WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY

1325,THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO INTUIT AND EVEN RUTH WAS FILLED EELPHIA ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARTIFICIAL PLATE UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST
1326,BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROAD STREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MEN NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SHINING THE DECLARATION AND PRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTER'S THAT STREET WINDOWS

1412,NO CATHEDRAL I EVEN BURGLAS ITSELF COULD VY WITH THE CHURCH OF MARCHRA
1413,BENZOV'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVED ACTS EARS BESIEGED WITH THE SCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLEL BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGE AS OF THIS ADVANTAGE
1414,WHEN A PRIVATE AND THE EIGHT CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SURVITACK
1415,THE BOND OF UNION IN THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SUFFERED AND ALTHOUGH BENIGNS OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINE ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER
1416,I MIGHT HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING IN CYCLIPEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPERS TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS
1417,THUS AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SURVIDA HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF
1418,IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVICTITY AND THE CONSEQUENTLYMENT OF THE RANGE OF THE REGION OF THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER

1423,THE WIND BEING AT FIRST THE DOVERINA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED HOME AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
1424,SIRVIDA TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE LINA WAS ENDEAVOURING TO PUT IN
1425,A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS
1426,SLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAIN SAIL AND AN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMS KNOWN CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPS TAILS BREAKING AND GIBB
1427,CAPTAINS ARE VIVID AT HASTENED TOWARD HIM

1433,TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
1434,SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
1435,YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT
1436,MY YACH IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TURE ROUND THE WORLD
1437,THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD
1438,BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE WITH THE ENGINE OF THE SUPREMENESS SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOULD IN CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH CEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT
1439,IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SKINNER WERE COMPLETED
1440,A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S OR BED WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
1441,DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BENZIVE TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
1442,HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR A SECOND NAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE
1443,AFTER AN APPRENTICEHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS A CUSTOM TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY PLEASING IN THE MATTER
1444,THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MENACEDLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PART OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
1445,STEEM UP AND CANVAS SPREAD THE SKINNER STARTED EASTWARDS
1446,ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARICAL SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF USALATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE AN
1447,FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGEARIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
1448,THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXON WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS
1449,THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
1450,AD THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBET BUT SHE IS NOT ENCOURING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PERSIPATED ON TO THE SUN
1451,AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION DO YOU OFFER ASKED STRIVID ACT EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN
1452,OCIOUS AND RAIN
1453,ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED A WAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE AJURIANT METROPOLIS
1454,IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
1455,WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCE OF THE CITY HAD LEAST BE VISIBLE
1456,I'M OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WAS MOST REMARKABLE
1457,TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AN ESPECIALLY OF LITTLE TIMBERCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FORTIFYING FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS
1458,YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALJARIA AS YOU IMAGINE
1459,AFTER PONDERING THE WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS
1460,ITS DEPTHS REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS A SITUATION IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARON OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
1461,NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN IN DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
1462,AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD ASKED
1463,WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRYL OFF HAD YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRALL'S EYES FLASHED

1533,THE SOUND OF AN IMPAIRED OF AN UNCERTAIN BELL OVER CALLED ME INTO THE REGIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY
1534,AMBOAS MET ME UPON THE STAIRS AND SHARED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM
1535,SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SLIMITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
1536,THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT IDOLOUSLY CONFESSED IN VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
1537,A NO MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM
1538,A LITTLE CRACKED THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE WAS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM
1539,MISTER MEDICAL THE ELDER HAVE IT NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF AT HER DUTIES THE NEW COMER TO ME WITH A SIGLENESS OF HIS SONS WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE AND AT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN

1546,ARE FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS
1547,FOR ONES ON WAY I PROVED A TRUE PROPHET
1548,NO NATUREFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION CROSSED THE TABLE BETWEEN ALE AND ME
1549,YOU LOOKED UP AT NOW ME GOTINGLY FROM HIS PLAY AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN
1550,WHEN I DRESSED AT ME HE ANSWERED TOO STRANGELY
1551,A MORE DREARY IN MORE DISTANT FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT OF TABLE WITH
1552,INVY HATRED MALICE AND UNTROUBLEDNESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST AND MAY OWE ME AND MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOOKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASTE BETWEEN HER ANNEBROWS
1553,I WISH YOU COULD NOT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MEADOW CROSS IN LITTLE CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WE'LL THE MOUTH TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE

1556,SILAS FLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMOROUS GROUND EVIDENTLY MEANT ON THE KEENEST PEACE WHEN THEY KNOW ME BEFORE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM
1557,IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECTS TO MUCH VERY ABILITY
1558,SOON IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
1559,THE VERY BILLITY OF MULTIPLE PARTS
1560,BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
1561,IF ACTS OF THE INCREASE USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS
1562,CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE RACES OF MAN
1563,AND DETERMINING WHETHER TWO AMOR ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RAN TO SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEIR EFFICILOGUE
1564,HE LEVIED A CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURE LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAIN THE PRIZE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TOLEADENS AND THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THEIR RIVER
1565,SUCURE AS HE THOUGHT AND THE CAREFUL HAD BEEN DISTRACTED IN A JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED THE INHABITANTS THE GOOD HAD IGOW WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILY
1566, RIDALL FOR AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MADE
1567,IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS FOR HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY OUR OFF TO PLEASE RUDAL FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARASISE READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TOOK AT THIS WORK OF THIS WICKED DESIGNATE TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TOOK AT THIS
1568,THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HAD THEIR FACES IN A FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GETTING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE OLD DATIOUS MEN
1569,FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXACTLY AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DISILLATION AND WILL
1570,WE'RE BOTH FOR RIVE AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT ANY ACADIOUS PARENTS REACHED THEIRS HEART BROKEN AND DESPAIR
1571,MEANWHILE RUDALPHILE HAD LOCATED A SAFE IN HIS CUSTOM AND HIS OWN APARTMENT
1572,TUCATIUS ME I AM I AM READ
1573,MOTHER DEAR FATHER DEAR ME
1574,IT IS THE ONLY IMMENSE I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
1575,SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE
1576,SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHOWN IN SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM
1577,SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE ABOUT THAT OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN
1578,AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW
1579,THIS PERSON WAS RESOLVED WITH THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO A QUAINT THEM BUT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
1580,ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY A TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TO WORDS AS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
1581,JOINKING WITH A MOTIONED YO MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
1582,THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRESHED BY ORDINARY CUNNING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY HIS OWNER AND HE WOULD HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LOCKED UP THERE
1583,WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDREAM IT WILL DAIN TO VENTURE CAUSE BY THIS RIGHTEOUS JUDGE
1584,THUS DID THEY SHOW MAIN AND WRITE MINDED FATHER COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN IT ALL SHE COULD TO SO THE FEELINGS
1585,SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETURNANT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHINING EVERY EYE LISTED SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE
1586,TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERSARY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE AND THE UPLACY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF IT WIFE AS SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON WHAT ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEE
1587,WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSING AWAY SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UP ON HIS BEAUTY ABOUT ON THE MOTHER THE BOYM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UP ON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM HOT SO WELL
1588,ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO A RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CALM COURSE OF HORSEMEN
1589,THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE IN SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT
1590,LUUS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT AND A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DREWING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
1591,THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DAWNY HIS SONYA WHO WAS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY IS A NATURAL AS CRUELTY AS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE THE FAINTING GIRL
1592,I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SAID NORA SAID DARNA TO HER HUSBAND THE QUEEN AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE THING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON
1593,THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFOENED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SON
1594,JUST THEN LEOPADE I CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND A GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN US OF A WILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END THERE KATE AS HOLSTER AND HE BELIEVED IT
1595,SO PERSUASINGLY WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG RESURANCE AS THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED THEMSELVES IN ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL
1596,FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER DID ME A WIFE FOR WOULD BE IN A AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO ROSE DISCUSSED ME HE SAID AT ME BOTH VERY EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL THE YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN AND SAID A PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER DEATH
1597,HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALK TO MATES WITH WAXELITES AND SILVER CANELSTICS
1598,ALROS TO DO HER REVERENCE AS A SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD BEEN IRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER AND TRANS WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER
1599,SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE PRICES WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESS OR UNHAPPY FOR EVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER MOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED A DEFINING
1600,HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS IN SENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
1601,NO THEN SON IN MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS PRETENCE
1602,JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOAT FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATION'S WOMEN MOST EXPRESSES OF DESPAIR THEY'LL KATY I GUESSINE'S OF RECOVER AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS FOR THE HEARTS OF ALL
1603,WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF AND RED OFF HIS ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGACIOUS HERSELF NO SAID YOU ARE HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLD YOU IN HIS SOOT
1604,THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE HAD A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH I NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
1605,NOR WAS FOR DOFFAL LESS SURPRISE THAN THEY AND A BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF WHO SO WONDERFUL EFFECT HE BEGGED NO KATE YET TO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH HAD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS
1606,YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEAK
1607,SAID LORD CHAUFORT ADDRESSING ME
1608,HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LAKE SHOULDER
1609,THERE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS
1610,WHATEVER LORD CHILLFORD SAID MISS BRAND AND RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE
1611,BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LICK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
1612,AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING
1613,I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WILDER CHUCKLING BINNINGANTLY ON IT OVER HE SHOULDER
1614,I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS
1615,AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLI A NEWSAMENT
1616,I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE BEAT PIECE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON
1617,WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS FLY EYES
1618,AND WILDER LAUGHTER LAUGHED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOR OF THE JOKES SEEMS QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNER'S OF HIS EYES UNLAKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY
1619,DO YOU KNOW OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRED OF COUNTRY LIFE
1620,HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS
1621,I HAVE HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THEN
1622,OH I KNOW THAT'S LORD BRANDING
1623,ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING WEEK
1624,MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
1625,AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
1626,WHICH DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY
1627,IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER
1628,I THIS TIME LORD CHILFRED AND WILDER RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I REMED IT ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP
1629,AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS KING TOWARDS BRENDED HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER
1630,YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE
1631,IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE IS BEALS ABOUT IT ONCE
1632,BROUGHT DINS A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
1633,I DON'T KNOW WHEN CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FIND GENTLEMEN TO FIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY
1634,WHILE YOU KNOW RADIE WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BROUGHTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKED HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED
1635,THERE WALKED CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID
1636,NOW THAT'S HIM POSSIBLE RADIE FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING
1637,THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOON LIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVER HANGING BOUGHS AND WITH THEIR LEAVES AND THE MUDDLE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PAIL FEATURES
1638,DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
1639,WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
1640,MARKED MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU I AND TOO DEEP
1641,I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT BUT EVER IT IS I CAN HELP IT
1642,TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIVELY AWFUL IN FAMILY FUBES
1643,THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR INVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY BY TALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HERS AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP ABOUT MALTIMITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE
1644,THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
1645,MY BED WAS UNEXPECTEDLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN
1646,IT CURTAINS WERE OF THICK AND FEEDED TOP THE STREET
1647,ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES
1648,I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLE MAN IN THE GHOST STORY WHAT SHE EXPERIMENTSILY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER
1649,I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY
1650,I'D BOLDLY LIGHTED MY INTERRUPTED
1651,A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
1652,THE SUMMER OLD TREES LIKE GIANT A CURSE PLUMS BLACK AND AWFUL
1653,SOME HOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS
1654,A LITTLE BIT OF PLAST HER TUMBLED THEM THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY
1655,IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRENDING DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN RICKET OF RED MINES FARM
1656,WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD A BAD NIGHT
1657,SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND THE PALE SMILE OF VULCAN
1658,WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHAME DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL JEALOUS
1659,BUT POOR RACHEL LAKE HAD MORE THAN THAT STOLICAL PAPA SEE WHICH ENABALS THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE
1660,THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP OUR BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGILING OUR SENSES
1661,THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TOLINS AND MANNER WHICH WAS NO DEGREE TILL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED TO THE GREEDY AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF
1662,RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED A HIGH STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE
1663,YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RETURNED
1664,ILL AND TROUBLED DEAR TROUBLED IN MIND AND MISERABLY NERVOUS
1665,POOR RACHEL HER NATURE WERE COILED FROM TO SEAT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
1666,SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LING WOULD EYES FLASH
1667,THINK YOU RACHEL MY COUSIN RACHEL MY ONLY FRIEND
1668,SHALLFORD HAD A NOTE FROM THE STAR WILDER THE MORNING ANOTHER NOTE HIS COMING TO LAID AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO WAS ABROAD CONTINUED DORCAS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE

1807,THE ACTS STRUCK INDEED INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANGENESS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL IT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME
1808,HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS
1809,THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL A AGREEABLE
1810,THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURT YARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
1811,THERE TWO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFLES AS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AND LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
1812,THE SERVANTS AS WAS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
1813,THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID

1817,CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
1818,A STORY
1819,A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
1820,BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
1821,HOW MAY DON'T BE THROW DOWN STAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS
1822,THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
1823,THOUGHT THE FURTRY AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL
1824,I WON'T TREMBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIRST TREE
1825,AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND INDEED THOUGHT
1826,IN THE MORNING THE SERVANT AND THE HOUSE MADE CAME IN
1827,BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STARES INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IT HAD DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
1828,WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
1829,AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN RIVER HE
1830,TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHT'S PAST ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID CALM IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN THE CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
1831,HIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE NOW WINKED HER
1832,HOW KIND MAN HE IS AFTER ALL
1833,IF IT ONLY WOULD NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY ONLY
1834,SQUAKE'S QUICK
1835,THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE VERDRIE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES
1836,I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIRST TREE
1837,THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM
1838,THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS
1839,I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
1840,AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID
1841,SAID THE FIRST TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF FOR LIGHTED
1842,YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES IN REALITY
1843,OH IS UP HE DON'T BE ASKED THEM EYES
1844,ONLY THAT ONE AND SO THE TREE
1845,IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY
1846,DON'T YOU KNOW ONE NOT ABOUT BACON AND TELLO KANDALLS CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LOUD OR STORIES
1847,NO SAID THE TREE
1848,THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME
1849,AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEP LITTLE MY SAT ROUND ME AND LISTENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
1850,NOW THAT TWO WAS OVER
1851,WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE INSECT TO WORK IN THE LOFT
1852,THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE
1853,BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
1854,IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES
1855,THE GOLD AND STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE
1856,IN THE COURT YARD SOME OF THE MARIAN CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FUR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD THAT THE SIGHT OF HIM
1857,AND THE GARDENERS BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAT BLIND THERE

1862,I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER
1863,IT WAS A DELIBERATE LEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT A GIRL HE LOVED
1864,BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVED A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF
1865,HE WAS SOFT HEARTED IN IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING ILL OF HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
1866,IF THE PROSECUTIONWARD WITH DRON AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FOUR CHECK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM

1910,BUT UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE JUDGMENT HIM
1911,THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE
1912,HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORTUNE CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP
1913,AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
1914,SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS AND NOTES THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORCE A DRESS OF CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPENT AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY

1955,SHE TALKED HER DAUGHTER THEN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR IT THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPEN FOR THEM
1956,THEY COUNT HAD THE THRONE HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEA LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS
1957,THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARRESSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND
1958,YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS HIM
1959,CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT
1960,IT IS YOU WERE A MISTAKE AND ROW I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY
1961,I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY OF YOU ENOUGH
1962,I AM CONVINCED OF ONE I SAY SAID THEY COUNT
1963,IT IS A KNOWING SON
1964,IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE
1965,BUT CONTINUED ROW NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS IN INDISCRETRIATE RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
1966,THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOUR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY ARE MASTERS AND OUR OWN
1967,YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THIS SAME MAN
1968,BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE ROW COULD TECH BEEN NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONSULATE
1969,THEN NIGHT WAS CLEAR SCARLET AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY IN THE SWEET INFLUENCE OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
1970,UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS IN A SECOND BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOZADE OF SHEET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES
1971,BRAY THE LAWN WASH FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT UP THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND UNSUBBLE SLUMBERS OF MANICAM WHOSE SNORT AS IMPRISONLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
1972,THE LIFE MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
1973,THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO NEAR THE SALUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
1974,THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED SENT THE A THING OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
1975,NOW WHAT IT IS THE SENSE OF IT TOO IN THIS IT BEAVES LIKE THAT
1976,BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT OUT HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
1977,THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DOWN LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
1978,HARS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME TO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DAIN CARE ABOUT IT
1979,NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY SINCE THIS BROW
1980,I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT SEEMS ENOUGH TO RO
1981,DO YOU SUPPOSE THE PICTURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
1982,WHEN THE WORLD IS IT QUEER JOYCE
1983,MAY WORRY ME TAMBLE AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT COULD IT SCHEME
1984,WILL COME IN HEAD THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON IN HALF A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
1985,IT CAN'T HURT ANY THING I'M SURE FOR WE BOTH DISTURBED THINGS AT ALL
1986,THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
1987,SWEGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARFINITE INTO THIS OTHER WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR SIT THE AHEAD ADDED A WHISPOON AND DUST HAND TO THE OUTFIT
1988,THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM ANY CAME SPORTING AFTER AS STRICTLY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH ASSENT THE AS DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
1989,OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
1990,HE MAKES IT SORT OF COZYER
1991,ALL ITS DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
1992,YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE OF VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
1993,SEARFESS AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
1994,THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED
1995,AND MY POCKET MONEY HE IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE IT ANY LEFT AS USUAL
1996,THEY SAY A ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
1997,WHY IT'LL LIE AT THIS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING AND
1998,IS IT HE THE GREATEST REPEATING INTO ODD CORNERS
1999,FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEES THEIR CANDLES AND STREAKED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SON AWED CORNER
2000,WELL I AM CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
2001,NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILINGING IN HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FRANCE HE AND NOT IN REALITY
2002,I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW CAFFER HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WALL AND HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT A HEAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
2003,ON WORRY SAID ADDITION VOICE
2004,NO SOUND BROKE THIS STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
2005,THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
2006,WHAT WAS THAT
2007,WHAT THEN I HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THIS SURFACE OF THE POND
2008,NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
2009,IT DID NOT BACK AN OR INDEED MOVE IT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
2010,I OWED TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS CATHERINE
2011,A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
2012,A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS A WAKE WHERE
2013,SAID HIM OF A VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZE THATFUL CHAIRS HALF HER
2014,I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHEN I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
2015,IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE READ WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALL SO DISCOLORED
2016,I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAYS TO BE WELL THIRD
2017,BUT THAT IS CHAFFER'S LIFE
2018,I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
2019,I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
2020,ALL CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
2021,I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
2022,A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
2023,I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
2024,PURCHANCE TOO CAFFERS DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
2025,MY TONGUE WERE FEWS TO OUR TICKULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
2026,MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
2027,MY OVER WROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
2028,FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
2029,THE THREE MOTIVES OF MANAGEMENT
2030,TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN AFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION IS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
2031,I REASON AND AFFECTION
2032,AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR THIS TRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT
2033,THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLAISANCY AND SENOUS FACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS
2034,SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
2035,THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELYS PARTLY UNCONCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
2036,IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
2037,BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
2038,IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BEORATED
2039,TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INTERESTS OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
2040,DELA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED RIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
2041,NOW GILIA CAN DRIVE TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND A TENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
2042,TO GIVE IT IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
2043,YOU HAVE COME AND TELL HER AND DELICATE WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALLY OF HIS
2044,I AM VERY GLAD
2045,I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN OF VERY GOOD GIRL ANDELA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
2046,THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
2047,FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAY THINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR THE PIAZZA OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES
2048,THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOGS IN THE PARLOUR
2049,DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKON THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DIANA AND ROSELY HAIR AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
2050,SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTO FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
2051,SAID SHE POINTING THE PLAYFINGS SEE
2052,PUT THESE PLAY THINGS ALL AWAKE AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
2053,AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REVIEW OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSON TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
2054,NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
2055,THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
2056,THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
2057,VASSED IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
2058,WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST IN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED
2059,THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER'S OBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
2060,BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
2061,HE MADE A BOUGH SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DONE FOUND IT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ENTERS
2062,HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
2063,NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID WAY THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HAND WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ENTERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALL MOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
2064,YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ENTERS
2065,SEEMED THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND AS IT THE KING
2066,I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ENTERS
2067,AND SHE TOOK ORDERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILT AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
2068,FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CHAPE
2069,AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLACE IN LONG ROWS
2070,ON HUGE SILVER PLATERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING TANTERS
2071,THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOOKCASE OF ROSES AND SHE LET AND HER SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
2072,BUT YOU MUST THAT EAT WITH YOUR CAMP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO THEY GET OFF
2073,THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
2074,HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
2075,WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
2076,THAT IS A VERY FINE COCK YOU HAVE HE SAID
2077,SO IT IS SAID ANSWERS
2078,AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YOUNG AND SHE KNITTED HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
2079,WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
2080,HE DARTED LAKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
2081,HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
2082,AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
2083,BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KINGS GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ENTERS WAS A STUPID
2084,ANDERS FACE GREW RED
2085,BUT HIS MOTHER HAD THEM CLOSE
2086,NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID
2087,IF YOU DRESSED IN SO AND GOLD FROM TOP TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
2088,AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE WAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD CAUSED SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT
2089,I VERY WELL
2090,LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF CALL BEAR HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF A KOREAN WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO CARTEERS
2091, JUT UP THE DEAR POSTS WHEREUPON SAND AND YAWN AND DEALER I TOOK THEIR LEAVE
2092,CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
2093,WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUIS
2094,HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
2095,IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COME PLAY WHEN THE KING FROWNED
2096,DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYOLOGANT
2097,NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
2098,YOUR MAJESTY'S PLANNED THEN AND THIS AFFAIR IS
2099,YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
2100,THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE REPETITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT CANDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COCRITORY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
2101,THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED AND AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
2102,THE QUEEN'S HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT D MAYORUS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THE THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
2103,SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACEAN ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
2104,THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRIAL WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ANTS
2105,HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILK AND HOSE OF SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
2106,THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BLIND MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEMED TO STORE ALONG
2107,YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
2108,FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVE IN GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THEY MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IN
2109,YES SIR AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALAY
2110,SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT TO PURCHASE TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SOME ALER ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
2111,THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
2112,MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
2113,THE BATTLE I BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
2114,WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BIRTHS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTETERED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS AT REACHED ITS COLUMBINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH
2115,DISTAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
2116,BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT AS LEMS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
2117,THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME AND REALITY THE PRINCIPAL ANSWER IN THE QUADRIEL CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
2118,EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PRESSRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE
2119,UPON THIS MADAME DEAN TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING
2120,DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE
2121,YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH HER OWN
2122,EXPLAIN YOURSELF
2123,I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS
2124,THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO
2125,SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE
2126,THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
2127,A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED
2128,WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED AND AMIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF
2129,RE MAY IN I IMPLOR YOU THE EVENING IS MOST LOVELY

2140,I AM A WOMAN AND THERE ARE FEW LIKE ME WHOEVER LOVES ME FLATTER'S ME WHOEVER FLATTER'S ME PLEASE ME AND WHOEVER PLEASE HIS WELL SAID MONTELY YOU DO NOT FINISH
2141,IT IS TOO DIFFICULT REPLIED MOUSE ELDERS OUT D'ARTAGNAN SHAW ON LAUGHING LOUDLY
2142,LOOKING UNDER DO YOU NOT SEE THE MOON SLOWLY RISING SILVERING THE TOP MOST BRANCHES OF THE CHESTNUTS AND THE OAKS
2143,EXCUYS IT SOFT TURF OF THE WOODS THE HAPPINESS WHICH ARE FRIENDSHIP CONFIRS UPON ME
2144,WELL SAID MILDEN WAS ILL DID TENATION I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE
2145,TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTONI SO THERE WHEN MUD WAS HELD IT TO FINISH HER ON THANKS AT THE NAY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT
2146,QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH READ GRASS SAID MONTELLEY STOOP AT THE NAME YOU ARE SO TALL
2147,THE YOUNG GIRLS HAD INDEED MADE THEMSELVES SMALL INDEED AND VISIBLE
2148,SHE WAS HERE JUST NOW SAID THE COUNT

2155,OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTERLY AND IT MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE
2156,LET US RUN THEN SAID ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERED OF THE PARK
2157,IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAMES AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
2158,AND THIS WAY THE FED OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FIT ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS AND HAPPENS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEAR IN THE BREAK THE PHAZZANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS WHOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
2159,ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED AND BROAD SPLASHES
2160,THE BRIGANDS ARE HAD ACCURSTED HEAD OF ERREDESCENT GREEN BLACK ABROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY CIDES FINALLY PENCILED AND BLACK AND LIGHT AND A BREAST OF RICH JUST NOT REDUCED WITH BLACK
2161,HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SOFT YOUTHS AND SHARP HOOK TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
2162,BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE ALLS HUCKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDERING LAWS
2163,BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIANA HE SHOT DOWN IN THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
2164,ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURDLY FOR HIS PERCH
2165,IN MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT A TROUT OF THE SIZE WILL A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
2166,BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUTES OF HIS IN GORGE DAM WERE STILL STICKING OUT OF THE GROZ OF HIS DID BEAK HIS FEARS RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE APPEARING DOWNWARD AND THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
2167,IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
2168,THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO A TREE FROM THE GROUND
2169,THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY THICK UP THE PRIZE AND HER JAWS AND TROTTED IN THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
2170,IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST BEENISH WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRANGE GALLANT WHEN THE BAVOLK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
2171,THE HAWK ELATED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISE
2172,LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TIL HE TOO HAD THOUGHT THE FEAR OF DEATH SUMMIT INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE A THARK OVER HANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WERE THE DREADFUL I HAVE THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
2173,THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRIES SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
2174,ALMOST INSTANTLY REST FORCE TO THE TOP
2175,STRATE WAY THE HAWK LIGHTED FROM HIS PERCHED AND DARTED AFTER HIM
2176,BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
2177,BUT THIS FREQUENTURE OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES IN THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPPADS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
2178,AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALENTS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVES HEAD
2179,WERE THE WEAVE IS FOR AN INSTANT SANK THE CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
2180,BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND YOU WERE ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD AND A CLOUD OF THUMP OLD DOONE HUNG LOW OF HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
2181,THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOG AND PURSUIT AS A WHEEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF WERE EVADED OR DECEIVED
2182,HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
2183,THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT GOT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HUCKS ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOPING ITSELF FIRMLY
2184,AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
2185,THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
2186,THE NO LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
2187,HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTYS OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY AFTER MANAGER'S NOD TO HIM AT YEARS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITH OUT CHARGE TO HIS IMPOSING ON THE PRICE OF GULF BALLS
2188,AS SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN ONE OF THE SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
2189,BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMAGES HAS HIS MOMENTS
2190,YOU ARE PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
2191,FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY
2192,BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME OR GOOD ENOUGH FOR PLUNCHE
2193,I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MEN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
2194,ANYHOW WITH A JOLLY EXCITED AND I CAN TO THE DIAL ALL RIGHT
2195,LIMMYRIER FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS
2196,AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HUMBLY ON THE LOOK OF
2197,HAM TO BE OR NOT TO BE
2198,NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SILVERY IS PLAIN
2199,INDEED IT WAS LEAST IN ME THE KEEN OUT OF HAMLETS TO LOOK WE A CLEVER PLAYER COULD DO SOME EXTENT INDICATE BEHOLD THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEAN
2200,WE MODERN'S HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
2201,IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT THE SOLIL ACQUIED OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALL OUT IS AN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TYPEING HOW SHALL A LOCAL WE BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
2202,AND SO ONE TILL HE GET THE END ONE OF JULIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NOT A MIDDLE OF THAT SORT
2203,THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE HEAVEN THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
2204,AND THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
2205,IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFESSORATE AND TOOLS AND WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL
2206,I WANT DOUBLE NINE PILLOW
2207,DEBLED NINE TWO THREE ELS INLAR THAT DOUBLE NOT YES FLOW IS A YOU HEAR O PAMAS SPEAKING
2208,I SAY AFTER WANDERING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS

2225,A STAGE MERELY A POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVED TO THE AUDIENCE OF THE ACTORS EVEN WHEN CALLED CHARLES WHOLE TREATMENT OR WHEN NERVES OUR REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU IN NAME

2231,BUT IT IS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MONNER DROWNED WITH PRESENTS DATE A PERFECTION
2232,LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UP HER WEST COAST POCKET
2233,THE BOTH THIS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS
2234,THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE
2235,THAT SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGED THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE TWO PARTIES
2236,FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE DECLARING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NEW MARK OF STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL ONE EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER ROUGHLY AND RESERVED LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE
2237,THE FREE STATE MAN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEY ARE INTELLIGENCE FERKURAGED AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD IT SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORY OLD FISHES THE LEGISLATURE THE VOUGEST LAWRENCE THE COURTS
2238,THIS WAS A FORMABLE RAY OF ADMAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DICE
2239,COME IN BY WAY OF THE MISERY RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BOARD A ROUGH INDIAN COMPANION IN FLANCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOULDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY AT FIRST TO THE FREE STAKE CAUSED
2240,HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WEST PORCOURT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO INFORMS THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PERSONAL SLAVERY AUDITORS
2241,ALL THE TERRITORYLED DIGNITARY'S REPRESSED IT GOVERNOR SHANNED AND PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THAT'S A GOVERNMENT CHIEF JUST AS THE CONFLICTING OF THE ACCOUTS
2242,ALL DISSENT ON ON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONG HOLD TOWNS LIKE LEVIN WORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WEALTHIER AND PUNISHED WITH PROHIBITION CURSIONED
2243,OF THE LENSINGS THE MABEL'S AND THE MURDERERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO KNOW THE FREQUENT AND TREASURES DETAILS
2244,THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE DAILY AT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WARREN CHANCES WHICH HAPPILY OR NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE END OF THE JEWEL AND MORE ISOLATED CHASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF
2245,SEVERAL HUNDRED INCREASED EIGHT MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
2246,IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY
2247,THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRESS FULL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
2248,ONE OF HIS MOLLISH A GENERAL SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWA WAS AT WARNS AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP STRACLES ANOTHER ROAD ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TRUTHS AT FORT LEVIN WORTH
2249,THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING WAS A VERY LEGIT TO INFORMS AS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP A FEDERAL TROOPS
2250,SIRVED JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS HIS SHOULD IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION THAT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STAKE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT
2251,LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME HIM AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUSTY VICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORYAL FISSALS EVOLVED FROM THE VULACE LOSS
2252,TO EMBARRASS THE DAMAGE AND EXPOSURE JUDGE LOOK HAUNTED A RED AGAINST THE EXCAVINER ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT
2253,THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSUMACY WAS SUMMONED NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE
2254,BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MANIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONOUS AND OUTLAWS
2255,FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BAREICATED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMPS AND SCALPORTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GIRL OF BANDS HALF PARTIS AND HALF PRINTEDORE
2256,THERE DISTINCT TEETH CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DIFFERENT
2257,THE PRIESTT MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE REIGNS WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRE SIDES
2258,THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES OR NECESSITIES
2259,IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES AND WARRENS AND IN THE REFUSAL OF EXCEVEEN ARE READER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHALL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES THEY GET THE TERRITORY O AND THE UNITED STATES LOST
2260,FIT NOTE SOME MERIT OF CHANNON MAY TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX
2261,PRIVIT PERSONS WHO HAD LEAST THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BE SOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY
2262,TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMBED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD
2263,HE SUMMON HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
2264,HE CONTINUED HIS PRETENDED SURGE AND TO GIVE COLOR TO HIS ERRAND MADE TO HER REST
2265,THE FREE STATE HOTEL THEY STONE BUILDING IN DIMENSIONS FIFTY BY SEVENTY FEET THREE STORIES HIGH AND HANDSOMELY FURNISHED PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED ONLY FOR LUNTING ROOMS ON THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME OPENED ITS TABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PUBLIC
2266,AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FIERCE
2267,TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDERCEIVED
2268,THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN
2269,HE PLANNED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANY
2270,HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE OF TELL
2271,AT JUSTIN WHO HAD BEEN HURRYING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GANS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAINED THEM APPLIED
2272,THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED TO THE STONE WALLS
2273,IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPHERE OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AIDS SOCIETY OF MASSITIOUS VINES IS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT EDUCATION
2274,THE HOPE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOTS SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROWS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF ORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND EXCESSARIES
2275,RE LOCATED FOOT NOT GOVERNOR ROBINS AND BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELLING STOPPED AT LEGS IN HIS EARLY
2276,IN A FEW DAYS AND OFFER CAME WITH A REPOSITION FROM GOVERNOR CHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND A WEST PORT AND AFTER WORDS FROM THEIR TO CANVONWORTH
2277,HERE HE WAS PLACE IN THE COSETITY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICAP WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED AND PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVEN WORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
2278,CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE
2279,IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINE A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PEARLS SLAVERY MAN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO LOOK UP IN THE CHAFEN
2280,THOUGH THREATENING TO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESS
2281,AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD MAY PEER OF MERCHANT'S SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LAGANS THE LAGANS THE PARSIONED TOO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE
2282,WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH CAVINANTAS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCALLICATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED
2283,THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPENED TO MONTEROUS COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREED TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL COALS IN SCOTLAND
2284,FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL COALS AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELKURTON WHO LAY IT BREATH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN A SIMPLETON
2285,DREADING THIS SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY WON'TROWS HASTEN NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MOCKY OF HAUNTY ANDUTHERS HASTEN NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSED AGAIN THE MONKEY
2286,THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND COMPROMPT WAS VERY LOW FOR MINUTEARY PRICE AND KNOCKED A SUMM SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WASTED HE HERE A LOUD MOMENT FROZE TO ESCAPE HIM
2287,BY QUICK MARTIANS THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREEDOM FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE CONVENTORS
2288,WITH THESE AND SOME REENFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHOLE MEN AND NOTE THEM HE HAD RECALLED MONTREA'S FOUL SUDDENLY UPON OUR GALLS COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT OLD RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE
2289,THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONSTROWS SLEDIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE UNIMACY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC COALS ARE GOAL CALICING THREE THOUSAND MEN MUCH
2290,BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH ONE TROVES HASTENED TO IN A LOCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISE BUT NOT A FRIGHTENED GOVERNOR'S
2291,HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THE SEA MERCHANTS APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
2292,MONTROWS WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINE HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND NOW TO PUDDING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUTE FELL WITH YOU NIGHT IT FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THERE WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT WOOD
2293,FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANY'S WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENCE COULD RETURN
2294,BESIDES MEMBERS OF PALMONT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICIAL FISSORS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS UNDEN BEWARELY FASCINATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY AND TO THE HANDS OF THATION
2295,THEY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PALANEMETERY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
2296,VALLA INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MINUTEARY OUGHT
2297,HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED AND HE THING BUT HAD LONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALET AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SIX
2298,HE POSTED THROUGH HENRY SN COWLINS AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HER OWN HILL
2299,THE SCOTTISH GENERAL'S AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ONLY EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SIT A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION
2300,THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
2301,OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
2302,AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL OUT SAID THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN POTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE SPY SPIES US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD BEEN IN BATHED IN BACK IN BATING BOX
2303,ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGONEMENT OR DID THIS SUM TO BE SOME
2304,THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT SUM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
2305,HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
2306,THE GOOD NATURED ODINES IN PITY TO FULL AND MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONE SCRATERNS TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SOME OF THE SUM WHICH THE FORMER HAD COLDFUL
2307,THE PODENED AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
2308,BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PALMONS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
2309,THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THE RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE POCKET WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WE CAN THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND DEPAPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST HAVE BEEN THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTH AND DEPAPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST WITHIN
2310,IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANK ARE AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WILL WISHES MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT A COMPANY AT HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH THAT CLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS AND WITH PRAYERS AND
2311,HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
2312,THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
2313,WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AN EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CHORAL SENSE ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
2314,WHETHER NOT THIS PRINCIPLE AS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MY HUMAN OVER STATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT I IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENTED IMPRESSION
2315,AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LARGELY POSSIBLE
2316,THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRING INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH THE POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A HOLY UNRUEL PASSED
2317,ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LARGE GOLDEN ABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
2318,THE BEHAVIRESS TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THAT THE RECORD
2319,HABIT IS A CONSTANT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOURISTS FILLS COFFET THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
2320,BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN AFFRENCE IS WARRITED
2321,OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY EMMAAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT HAVE VOTE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
2322,WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH SHE HAD WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRANCE FAITH VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
2323,SOME IMAGES LIKES SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS SOCIAL STRANGE
2324,THE MILLIARDI IS A FILLING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
2325,IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN AND THAT OF THE UNFERE MILLER PARTS
2326,I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2327,THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TOO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
2328,IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CAN OCCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME RIMPERED EVENT
2329,THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FILLING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
2330,THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEDY EFFECT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
2331,IT WOULD SEEM AT THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FILLINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATIONS TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING GEMBERGS
2332,IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
2333,REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURS IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS A MEMBER
2334,SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
2335,IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
2336,THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUPPUTABLE DATA IS SET THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
2337,WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THE PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY TO FIND MEMORY AS S THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ENLOGUE AND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOSE SOME EXPECTATIONS
2338,THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
2339,I GRIM A THRONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCONENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GROUND ORPHONE AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
2340,I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBER BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHOLLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
2341,THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RESIDED OR READ IT
2342,SIMON'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MERRY AT ALL CLOSELY
2343,THEY GIVE WALLS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCE AS COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFERRED TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTION KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
2344,IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
2345,IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
2346,WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIAR TO OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAVES US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRMENTS UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
2347,THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
2348,A FARTHER STAGE AS RECOGNITION
2349,RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAT A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEN AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUTITORIOUS IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO WE MAY HAPPEN TO WORK TO WORK TO WE MAY HAPPEN TO RETORT
2350,WE ARE OF COURSE AND FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION AND THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVER THE LESS HAVE THE HIGHEST
2351,THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY AND ONCE SINCE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
2352,THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH A COUNT OF RECOGNITION IS AN ADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
2353,THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONDUCTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCEDING NOW BY CERTAIN LENGTH OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
2354,THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION THE RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARK BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE THAT FROM THE RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARK BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLE THAT
2355,OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS OF PREMOUTH
2356,I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER AND ANOTHER LIGHT
2357,HAD EVER CRUSTWLER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK AND STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINTEN OVER REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BONEY AND THE BARKEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A RADI FOR THE FINAL OF MY IRE AM
2358,ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SHALLOWN WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
2359,AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MOTIVE ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
2360,I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING AND THE DISTINCORER OF THE WORLD
2361,WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE IS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WAR
2362,WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLEAX SAID MY WIFE
2363,QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVIL
2364,THE LADIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HORROR WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC OR ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED OR ON THE OTHER
2365,NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
2366,THERE MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVER BENED
2367,I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN ABOUT LIFE'S THE TOUCH OF HARM PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
2368,MISSUS NEVER BEEN YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
2369,JACK HEAVEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
2370,SIR KENNED AN OVER IS A VERY FINE PLAYERS SAID MY WIFE
2371,I AND MY WIFE AND SUN AND THE TWO CREST WEATHERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
2372,THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVORED TO BE HAY MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BE FITHEATIGATION BUT I COULD NOT APPEAL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
2373,MY WIFE ON THE SPARE THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
2374,THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH THERE
2375,THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
2376,OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NO WEAR
2377,BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY ENEMIES BEFORE LONG
2378,OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER BEEN HAD GONE THROUGH IMPROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF PARTS AND JEALOUS FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
2379,WE SAT WITH THE OFFER SIR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WHEN A SHORE
2380,HOW MUCH OF EVIL A REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
2381,WE'LL CUT I DO NOW BUT JUST BLAME MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
2382,AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DROPPED COULD NOT ALAS
2383,WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHER'S SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN CONCLUSION WHAT I AND MY DAYS
2384,JACK WOULD BECOME EVEN AS HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN A MIST THE HERODITIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
2385,THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
2386,MISTER NIVER BENT BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT THERE CANNOT BE THEN I THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
2387,YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH HER CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
2388,IT IS A DUTY SAID I
2389,BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
2390,NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TROUBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU
2391,THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER BEEN SAID SIR FERDINANDO BROWN
2392,I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY PERILOUS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE
2393,YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION
2394,THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH A COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY
2395,I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE SUGAR SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BOARD
2396,THEN SAID SIR FOR NO THERE'S NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
2397,THE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOT WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEED IT ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELL
2398,YOU HEAR WHAT'S SIR FERDINANDAL BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN ABOUT AXE
2399,BUT WHAT IS TO DELICATE MISSION I ASKED
2400,I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE AND MATTER NOT WHICH
